# COSMOLOGY
1. Fundamentals of Relativistic Cosmology
(the cosmological and Copernican principles, FLRW metric, 
Friedmann equations, conservation of energy in an expanding 
universe, Hubble-Lemaître law and peculiar velocities, spatial 
geometry of the universe, cosmological constant)
2. The Evolution of the Universe
(single and multicomponent solutions of Friedmann equations, 
the LCDM cosmological model, characteristics of dark matter 
and dark energy, observational pillars of the Big Bang theory, 
the future of the universe)
3. Precision Cosmological Measurements: SNe Ia and Large-scale 
structure (application of SNe Ia in precision cosmology, the 
origin of density fluctuations, linear fluctuation growth, 
large-scale structure of the universe)
4. Precision Cosmological Measurements: the Cosmic Microwave 
Background (the origin and properties of CMB, CMB anisotropies, 
cosmological analysis of the CMB power spectrum, primordial 
gravitational waves)
5. Particle cosmology
(thermodynamics of relativistic and nonrelativistic particles; 
decoupling of particles; the entropy of the Universe; the 
temperature of the neutrino gas; particle horizon)
6. Thermal history of the Universe
(primordial nucleosynthesis, the determination of the 
baryon-photon ratio and the baryon density parameter; 
matter-radiation equilibrium; recombination; the connection 
between time, temperature, and distance; cosmic calendar)
7. Cosmological inflation
(the horizon problem and the smoothness problem; cosmological 
equation of motion, energy density and pressure of a classical 
scalar field; inflationary potential inspired by GUT spontaneous 
symmetry breaking: the typical time and energy scale of inflation; 
inflationary solution of the cosmological problems)
