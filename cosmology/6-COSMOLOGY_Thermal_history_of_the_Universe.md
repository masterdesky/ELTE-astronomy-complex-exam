# 6. Thermal history of the Universe

## 6.1. Primordial nucleosynthesis
Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) or primordial nucleosynthesis refers to the production of nuclei other than those of the lightest isotope of hydrogen ($\ce{^{1}\mathrm{H}}$, or simply protons) during the early phases of the universe, specifically within the first few minutes after the Big Bang. It is responsible for the formation of stable, light isotopes: $\ce{^{2}\mathrm{H}}$ (deuterium), $\ce{^{3}\mathrm{He}}$, $\ce{^{4}\mathrm{He}}$, and a small amount of $\ce{^{7}\mathrm{Li}}$.

Prior to BBN, the universe was too hot and dense for atomic nuclei to exist. Protons and neutrons continually interacted through weak nuclear forces, maintaining a state of thermal equilibrium. Proton- and neutron decay were happening at an equal rate, thus maintaining a $1:1$ ration of protons and neutrons. As the universe expanded and cooled and the weak nuclear force became less effective, the decay rate of neutrons became slower than that of protons due to the lower mass of protons and their ration shifted in favor of protons. This process is also known as the weak interaction freeze-out.

BBN began about $10$ - $20$ seconds after the Big Bang, when the universe had cooled enough for deuterium to survive. Deuterium acted as a catalyst for the formation of $\ce{^{4}\mathrm{He}}$, and within a few minutes, nearly all of the neutrons had been incorporated into $\ce{^{4}\mathrm{He}}$. The process effectively ended about $20$ minutes after the Big Bang, when the universe had cooled to the point that nuclear fusion could no longer occur. At the start of the BBN, the ratio of protons to neutrons was about $6:1$ and ended up at about $7:1$ after the BBN.

The abundances of light elements predicted by BBN theory match the observed abundances remarkably well. This agreement is one of the major pieces of evidence for the Big Bang model.

## 6.4. Recombination
In the early matter-dominated era, as the universe continued to expand and cool, two closely related events occurred: the reionization and decoupling of matter.

Decoupling in cosmology refers to the moment when different types of particles stop interacting with each other and start to evolve independently. This is a crucial concept in the evolution of the universe, as it marks the transition from a state where all particles are in thermal equilibrium to a state where different types of particles have different temperatures and densities.

Although it isn't the first instance of decoupling in the history of the universe, the most famous example is the decoupling of photons from baryons, which occurred about $380\,000$ years after the Big Bang. Before this time, the universe was so hot and dense that photons were constantly being absorbed and re-emitted by electrons and protons, keeping them in thermal equilibrium. However, as the universe expanded and cooled, protons and electrons combined to form neutral hydrogen atoms in a process known as recombination. Photons could no longer interact with these neutral atoms as effectively, and they started to travel freely through the universe without being scattered. This is the moment of photon decoupling, and the cosmic microwave background radiation that we observe today is the afterglow of this event.

Neutrinos also underwent a similar process of decoupling earlier in the history of the universe, when the universe was about one second old. Before this time, neutrinos were in thermal equilibrium with electrons, positrons, and photons. However, as the universe cooled, the interaction rate of neutrinos decreased, and they decoupled from the rest of the matter and radiation.
