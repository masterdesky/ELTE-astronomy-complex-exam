# 6. Thermal history of the Universe
The thermal history of the universe is a fascinating journey through the various stages of the universe's evolution, from the hot, dense state immediately following the Big Bang to the current era of galaxies, stars, and planets. This history is characterized by a series of phase transitions, each marking a significant change in the universe's physical properties and behavior.

The universe's thermal history is closely tied to its expansion. As the universe expands, it cools, and this cooling triggers the various phase transitions that mark the different epochs in the universe's history. These transitions include the formation of atomic nuclei, the decoupling of matter and radiation, and the formation of atoms, among others.

Understanding the thermal history of the universe is crucial for cosmology, as it provides a framework for understanding the universe's large-scale structure and the distribution of galaxies. It also provides a backdrop for the study of cosmic microwave background radiation, the oldest light in the universe, which carries information about the universe's early stages.

## 6.1. Primordial nucleosynthesis
Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) or primordial nucleosynthesis refers to the production of nuclei other than those of the lightest isotope of hydrogen ($\ce{^{1}\mathrm{H}}$, or simply protons) during the early phases of the universe, specifically within the first few minutes after the Big Bang. It is responsible for the formation of stable, light isotopes: $\ce{^{2}\mathrm{H}}$ (deuterium), $\ce{^{3}\mathrm{He}}$, $\ce{^{4}\mathrm{He}}$, and a small amount of $\ce{^{7}\mathrm{Li}}$.

Prior to BBN, the universe was too hot and dense for atomic nuclei to exist. Protons and neutrons continually interacted through weak nuclear forces, maintaining a state of thermal equilibrium. Proton- and neutron decay were happening at an equal rate, thus maintaining a $1:1$ ratio of protons and neutrons. As the universe expanded and cooled and the weak nuclear force became less effective, the decay rate of neutrons became slower than that of protons due to the lower mass of protons and their ratio shifted in favor of protons. This process is also known as the weak interaction freeze-out.

BBN began about $10$ - $20$ seconds after the Big Bang, when the universe had cooled enough for deuterium to survive. Deuterium acted as a catalyst for the formation of $\ce{^{4}\mathrm{He}}$, and within a few minutes, nearly all of the neutrons had been incorporated into $\ce{^{4}\mathrm{He}}$. The process effectively ended about $20$ minutes after the Big Bang, when the universe had cooled to the point that nuclear fusion could no longer occur. At the start of the BBN, the ratio of protons to neutrons was about $6:1$ and ended up at about $7:1$ after the BBN.

The abundances of light elements predicted by BBN theory match the observed abundances remarkably well. This agreement is one of the major pieces of evidence for the Big Bang model.

## 6.2. The determination of the baryon-photon ratio and the baryon density parameter
The baryon-photon ratio, denoted by $\eta$, is a crucial parameter in cosmology. It is defined as the number of baryons (protons and neutrons) $N_{b}$ per photon $N_{\gamma}$ in the universe. This ratio is important because it influences the production of light elements during the Big Bang nucleosynthesis.

The baryon-photon ratio can be determined from observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and from measurements of the abundance of light elements. The CMB provides a snapshot of the universe at the time of photon decoupling, and its temperature fluctuations can be used to infer the baryon-photon ratio. Its value is approximately

$$
    \eta = \frac{N_{b}}{N_{\gamma}}
    \simeq
    2.75 \times 10^{-8}\ \Omega_{b} h^{2}
    \, .
$$

The baryon density parameter that appears in the above equation, denoted by $\Omega_{b}$, is another important cosmological parameter. It is defined as the ratio of the actual density of baryonic matter $\varrho_{b}$ in the universe to the critical density $\varrho_{c}$. The critical density is the density required to halt the universe's expansion and make it geometrically flat. The value of $\Omega_{b}$ can also be determined from observations of the CMB and from large-scale structure surveys. As of 2023, the best estimate of $\Omega_{b}$ from the Planck 2018 data release is

$$
    \Omega_{b} h^{2} = 0.0224 \pm 0.0001
    \, .
$$

Here, the dimensionless Hubble parameter $h$ is defined as $H_{0} = 100\, h\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}}$, where $H_{0}$ is the Hubble constant. It is customary to express the baryon density parameter in terms of $\Omega_{b} h^{2}$, as this quantity is more precisely determined from observations than $\Omega_{b}$.

The accurate measurement of the baryon density parameter is crucial for understanding the universe's structure and evolution. For example, it influences the formation of galaxies and large-scale structures in the universe.

## 6.3. Matter-radiation equilibrium
In the early universe, matter and radiation were in thermal equilibrium, meaning they had the same temperature and were constantly interacting. As the universe expanded and cooled, there came a point when the energy density of matter and radiation became equal. This point is known as the matter-radiation equality.

Before matter-radiation equality, the universe was radiation-dominated, meaning that radiation (photons and neutrinos) contributed more to the total energy density of the universe than matter (baryons and dark matter). After matter-radiation equality, the universe became matter-dominated.

The time of matter-radiation equality is a significant milestone in the universe's history because it marks the transition from a universe dominated by radiation to one dominated by matter. This transition had profound effects on the universe's structure formation. For instance, before matter-radiation equality, the growth of density fluctuations (which later formed galaxies and large-scale structures) was suppressed by radiation pressure. After matter-radiation equality, density fluctuations could grow unhindered, leading to the formation of the universe's large-scale structure.

The matter-radiation equality occurred when the universe was around $50\,000$ years old, and the temperature of the universe was about $10\,000 \operatorname{K}$.

## 6.4. Recombination
In the early matter-dominated era, as the universe continued to expand and cool, two closely related events occurred: the reionization and decoupling of matter.

Decoupling in cosmology refers to the moment when different types of particles stop interacting with each other and start to evolve independently. This is a crucial concept in the evolution of the universe, as it marks the transition from a state where all particles are in thermal equilibrium to a state where different types of particles have different temperatures and densities.

Although it isn't the first instance of decoupling in the history of the universe, the most famous example is the decoupling of photons from baryons, which occurred about $380\,000$ years after the Big Bang. Before this time, the universe was so hot and dense that photons were constantly being absorbed and re-emitted by electrons and protons, keeping them in thermal equilibrium. However, as the universe expanded and cooled, protons and electrons combined to form neutral hydrogen atoms in a process known as recombination. Photons could no longer interact with these neutral atoms as effectively, and they started to travel freely through the universe without being scattered. This is the moment of photon decoupling, and the cosmic microwave background radiation that we observe today is the afterglow of this event.

Neutrinos also underwent a similar process of decoupling earlier in the history of the universe, when the universe was about one second old. Before this time, neutrinos were in thermal equilibrium with electrons, positrons, and photons. However, as the universe cooled, the interaction rate of neutrinos decreased, and they decoupled from the rest of the matter and radiation.

## 6.5. The connection between time, temperature, and distance
In cosmology, understanding the relationship between time, temperature, and distance is crucial for describing the evolution of the universe. This relationship is deeply intertwined with the concept of an expanding universe, and it is best understood through the use of comoving coordinates, redshift, and the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation.

In an expanding universe, the physical distance between two objects changes with time as the universe expands. To account for this, cosmologists use the concept of *comoving distance*, which is a measure of distance that removes the effects of cosmic expansion. Comoving distance is defined as the distance between two points measured along a path defined at the current time, and it remains constant with time. The comoving distance ($\chi$) to an object at redshift $z$ is given by the integral:

$$
    \chi(t)
    \equiv
    \int_{0}^{z} \frac{\mathrm{d} z'}{H(z')} \, ,
$$

where $a(t)$ is the scale factor, $H(z)$ is the Hubble parameter and $z$ is the redshift. As the universe expands, the wavelength of light traveling through space increases, a phenomenon known as redshift. The redshift $z$ is defined as the change in wavelength relative to its original wavelength, and it is related to the scale factor $a(t)$ by:

$$
    1 + z = \frac{1}{a(t)} \, .
$$

The redshift can also be interpreted as a measure of time, with higher redshifts corresponding to earlier times in the universe's history.

The temperature of the universe is directly related to the average energy of photons, which decreases as the universe expands due to the redshift of light. Therefore, the temperature of the universe decreases over time. The temperature $T$ of the universe at any time $t$ is given by:

$$
    T(t)
    \propto
    \frac{1}{a(t)}
    \, ,
$$

This relationship shows that as the universe expands (i.e., as $a$ increases), the temperature decreases. This is a direct consequence of the redshift of the cosmic microwave background radiation, which is the afterglow of the Big Bang.

## 6.6. Cosmic calendar
The Cosmic Calendar is a method to visualize the chronology of the universe, scaling its current age of 13.8 billion years to a single year in order to help intuitively understand the relative times of events. This concept was popularized by Carl Sagan in his book and television series "Cosmos".

In the Cosmic Calendar, the Big Bang takes place at the beginning of January 1, and the current time is the end of December 31. Each month represents a little over a billion years, and each day represents nearly 40 million years.

Here are some key events in the Cosmic Calendar:

- **January 1**: The Big Bang occurs. The universe begins to expand rapidly, and it is extremely hot and dense.
- **January 10**: The first stars begin to form. These are massive, hot stars that live fast and die young, enriching the universe with heavier elements when they explode as supernovae.
- **March 15**: The Milky Way galaxy forms.
- **September 2**: The Solar System forms. The Sun is a second- or third-generation star, benefiting from the enriched material from previous generations of stars.
- **September 4**: Earth forms, and the oldest rocks on Earth form soon after.
- **September 21**: Life begins on Earth. The first life forms are simple, single-celled organisms.
- **December 17**: The first multicellular organisms appear.
- **December 26**: The first land plants appear on Earth.
- **December 30**: The first mammals appear.
- **December 31, 11:59:46 PM**: Humans appear.
- **December 31, 11:59:59 PM**: All of recorded history occurs in the last second of the Cosmic Calendar.

The Cosmic Calendar helps us appreciate the vastness of cosmic time and the relatively recent appearance of humans in the cosmic scheme. It's a humbling perspective that underscores our brief presence in the universe's long history.
