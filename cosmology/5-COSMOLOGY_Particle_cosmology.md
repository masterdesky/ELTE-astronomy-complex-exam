## 5.1. Thermodynamics of relativistic and nonrelativistic particles
In the early universe, particles were in a state of thermal equilibrium. The thermodynamics of these particles can be understood in terms of two regimes: relativistic and nonrelativistic.

Relativistic particles are those whose kinetic energy is comparable to or greater than their rest mass energy. They follows either the Fermi-Dirac statistics or Bose-Einstein statistics, depending on whether they are fermions or bosons. The energy density of a relativistic gas is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature $T^{4}$, and the pressure is one third of the energy density. The Fermi-Dirac statistics is given by the distribution for the occupation number as

$$
    \bar{n}_{i} = \frac{1}{e^{(e_{i} - \mu)/k_{B}T}+1} \, ,
$$

where $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, $\mu$ is the total chemical potential, and $e_{i}$ is the energy of the single-particle state $i$. Similarly to the F-D statistics, the Bose-Einstein statistics is given by the distribution function

$$
    \bar{n}_{i} = \frac{g_{i}}{e^{(e_{i} - \mu)/k_{B}T}-1} \, ,
$$
where $g_{i}$ is the degeneracy of the energy level $i$, $e_{i}$ is the energy of the state $i$.

Nonrelativistic particles, on the other hand, are those whose kinetic energy is much less than their rest mass energy. They follow the Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics

$$
    \bar{n}_{i} = \frac{g_{i}}{e^{(e_{i} - \mu)/k_{B}T}} \, .
$$

The energy density of a nonrelativistic gas is proportional to the number density of particles and their average kinetic energy, which is proportional to the temperature $T$.

The transition from relativistic to nonrelativistic regimes is characterized by the temperature dropping below the rest mass energy of the particles. This is known as "freeze-out" and has important implications for the evolution of the universe, especially for the research of the cosmic microwave background radiation.

The following sections will provide a description to the key concept in this topic, which is to understand how the behavior of particles changes as the universe expands and cools, and how this impacts the evolution of the universe.

## 5.2. Decoupling of particles
Decoupling in cosmology refers to the moment when different types of particles stop interacting with each other and start to evolve independently. This is a crucial concept in the evolution of the universe, as it marks the transition from a state where all particles are in thermal equilibrium to a state where different types of particles have different temperatures and densities.

The most famous example of decoupling is the decoupling of photons from baryons, which occurred about 380,000 years after the Big Bang. Before this time, the universe was so hot and dense that photons were constantly being absorbed and re-emitted by electrons and protons, keeping them in thermal equilibrium. However, as the universe expanded and cooled, protons and electrons combined to form neutral hydrogen atoms in a process known as recombination. Photons could no longer interact with these neutral atoms as effectively, and they started to travel freely through the universe without being scattered. This is the moment of photon decoupling, and the cosmic microwave background radiation that we observe today is the afterglow of this event.

Neutrinos also underwent a similar process of decoupling earlier in the history of the universe, when the universe was about one second old. Before this time, neutrinos were in thermal equilibrium with electrons, positrons, and photons. However, as the universe cooled, the interaction rate of neutrinos decreased, and they decoupled from the rest of the matter and radiation.

## 5.3. Big Bang nucleosynthesis
Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) refers to the production of nuclei other than those of the lightest isotope of hydrogen ($\ce{^{1}\mathrm{H}}$, or simply protons) during the early phases of the universe, specifically within the first few minutes after the Big Bang. It is responsible for the formation of stable, light isotopes: $\ce{^{2}\mathrm{H}}$ (deuterium), $\ce{^{3}\mathrm{He}}$, $\ce{^{4}\mathrm{He}}$, and a small amount of $\ce{^{7}\mathrm{Li}}$.

Prior to BBN, the universe was too hot and dense for atomic nuclei to exist. Protons and neutrons continually interacted through weak nuclear forces, maintaining a state of thermal equilibrium. Proton- and neutron decay were happening at an equal rate, thus maintaining a $1:1$ ration of protons and neutrons. As the universe expanded and cooled and the weak nuclear force became less effective, the decay rate of neutrons became slower than that of protons due to the lower mass of protons and their ration shifted in favor of protons. This process is also known as the weak interaction freeze-out.

BBN began about $10$ - $20$ seconds after the Big Bang, when the universe had cooled enough for deuterium to survive. Deuterium acted as a catalyst for the formation of $\ce{^{4}\mathrm{He}}$, and within a few minutes, nearly all of the neutrons had been incorporated into $\ce{^{4}\mathrm{He}}$. The process effectively ended about $20$ minutes after the Big Bang, when the universe had cooled to the point that nuclear fusion could no longer occur. At the start of the BBN, the ratio of protons to neutrons was about $6:1$ and ended up at about $7:1$ after the BBN.

The abundances of light elements predicted by BBN theory match the observed abundances remarkably well. This agreement is one of the major pieces of evidence for the Big Bang model.

## 5.4. Dark matter
*See also [chapter 2](./2-COSMOLOGY_The_Evolution_of_the_Universe.md) for more info and [chapter 1](./1-COSMOLOGY_Fundamentals_of_Relativistic_Cosmology.md) for relevant equations.*

Dark matter is a form of matter that does not interact with electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible and detectable only through its gravitational effects. It is one of the major components of the universe, making up about 27% of its total energy density, according to current estimates.

The existence of dark matter was first inferred from its gravitational effects on the rotation curves of galaxies. Stars in the outer regions of spiral galaxies were observed to move at speeds that would cause them to escape the gravitational pull of the galaxy if only visible matter were present. This discrepancy, known as the galaxy rotation problem, suggested the presence of an unseen mass providing additional gravitational attraction.

Dark matter also plays a crucial role in the large-scale structure of the universe. The distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters on large scales and the pattern of cosmic microwave background fluctuations both provide strong evidence for dark matter.

While the nature of dark matter is still unknown, the leading candidates are new types of subatomic particles that interact weakly with ordinary matter, known as WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles), and axions. Direct and indirect detection experiments are currently underway to search for these particles.

## 5.5. Dark energy
*See also [chapter 2](./2-COSMOLOGY_The_Evolution_of_the_Universe.md) for more info and [chapter 1](./1-COSMOLOGY_Fundamentals_of_Relativistic_Cosmology.md) for relevant equations.*

Dark energy is a hypothetical form of energy that permeates all of space and tends to accelerate the expansion of the universe. It is the leading explanation for observations since the 1990s that the universe appears to be expanding at an accelerating rate. As of now, it is estimated to constitute approximately 68% of the total energy in the observable universe.

The simplest explanation for dark energy is that it is a cosmological constant, or vacuum energy, as proposed by Albert Einstein in his field equations of general relativity. This is energy that exists in space itself, and it has a constant density regardless of the volume under consideration. This leads to a positive value for the cosmological constant, which corresponds to a negative pressure contributing to the accelerated expansion of the universe.

Another explanation involves a dynamic field, whose energy density can vary in time and space. This is often referred to as quintessence. Unlike the cosmological constant, this field can change its configuration under the influence of physical processes, leading to a time-dependent equation of state.

Despite its unknown nature, dark energy has a profound impact on the evolution of the universe. It determines the ultimate fate of the universe, with the accelerated expansion leading to a scenario known as the "Big Freeze", where the universe continues expanding and cooling indefinitely.

## 5.6. Inflation
Inflation is a theory in physical cosmology that describes an extremely rapid exponential expansion of the early universe by a factor of at least $10^{78}$ in volume, driven by a negative-pressure vacuum energy density. The inflationary epoch lasted from $10^{-36}$ seconds after the Big Bang to sometime between $10^{-33}$ and $10^{-32}$ seconds.

The theory of inflation resolves several problems in Big Bang cosmology that were discovered in the 1970s. These include the horizon problem, which is the question of why distant places in the universe have the same temperature and are in thermal equilibrium, despite the fact that light has not had time to travel between them. Inflation explains this by suggesting that all regions of the universe were in contact before the inflationary period and could thus have reached a common temperature.

Another problem addressed by inflation is the flatness problem, which is the question of why the universe appears to be very close to spatially flat. Inflation explains this by suggesting that the universe was smoothed out during the inflationary period, similar to how the surface of a balloon appears flatter as it is inflated.

The theory of inflation also provides a mechanism for the generation of the primordial density fluctuations that gave rise to the large-scale structure of the universe. These fluctuations are thought to have originated as quantum fluctuations in the inflation field, which were stretched to cosmic scales during inflation.

## 5.7. The entropy of the Universe
Entropy is a fundamental concept in thermodynamics that quantifies the amount of disorder or randomness in a system. In cosmology, the entropy of the universe is a measure of its disorder and is thought to have been increasing since the Big Bang.

The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that the total entropy of an isolated system can never decrease over time, and remains constant if and only if all processes are reversible. However, the universe is not in thermal equilibrium and is expanding, which allows its entropy to increase.

In the early universe, the entropy was relatively low. This is because the universe was in a highly ordered state, with matter and energy distributed uniformly. As the universe expanded and cooled, structures began to form due to gravitational instability, leading to an increase in entropy. Microscopic, primordial fluctuations grew into galaxies and galaxy clusters, which are highly disordered systems.

According to the "Big Freeze" theory, the entropy of the universe will increase to a point where all matter and energy will reach thermal equilibrium, and the universe will reach a state of maximum entropy. This is known as the heat death of the universe.

## 5.8. The temperature of the neutrino gas
Neutrinos are fundamental particles that interact only weakly with matter, making them difficult to detect. In the early universe, neutrinos were in thermal equilibrium with photons and other particles, and they had the same temperature. However, as the universe expanded and cooled, neutrinos decoupled from other particles and started to evolve independently. This event happened at a temperature of about $2.5$ MeV, when the universe was about $1$ second old.

After neutrinos decoupled, the universe continued to expand and cool, and the energy of individual neutrinos decreased. However, the number density of neutrinos remained constant, so the temperature of the neutrino gas also decreased. This is similar to the cooling of the cosmic microwave background radiation, which is the afterglow of the photon decoupling.

Today, the temperature of the neutrino gas and the photon gas (the CMB) is slightly different. This is because the universe was filled with electron-positron pairs at the time of neutrino decoupling, and these pairs later annihilated to produce additional photons, heating the photon gas but not the neutrino gas.

From this two state (equilibrium for neutrinos and then equilibrium for photons after the neutrino decoupling), we can estimate the ratio between the temperature of the neutrino gas $T_{\nu}$ and the temperature of the CMB $T_{\gamma}$ as

$$
    \frac{T_{\nu}}{T_{\gamma}}
    =
    \left( \frac{g_{2}}{g_{1}} \right)^{\frac{1}{3}} \, .
$$

Here the $g$ values represent the sum of the number of degrees of freedom of all particle types involved in the equilibrium processes mentioned above. The values $g_{1}$ is the sum of the degrees of freedom of photons, electrons and positrons. Then $g_{2}$ concerns only photons with no additional particles. Using the degrees of freedom of photons $g_{\gamma} = 2$ and electrons and positrons $g_{e\pm} = 7/4$, we can calculate the ratio as

$$
    \frac{T_{\nu}}{T_{\gamma}}
    =
    \left( \frac{g_{2}}{g_{1}} \right)^{\frac{1}{3}}
    =
    \left( \frac{4}{11} \right)^{\frac{1}{3}}
    \approx
    0.714 \, .
$$

Today, the temperature of the neutrino background is predicted to be about $1.946 \operatorname{K}$, slightly lower than the temperature of the cosmic microwave background, which is about $2.725 \operatorname{K}$.

## 5.9. Particle horizon
The particle horizon is the maximum distance from which particles could have traveled to the observer in the age of the universe. It represents the boundary between the observable and the unobservable regions of the universe. The existence of the particle horizon is due to the finite speed of light and the finite age of the universe.

In an expanding universe, the particle horizon is not simply the age of the universe times the speed of light, because the universe has been expanding, and distances between objects have been increasing during the light's journey. Therefore, the current proper distance to the particle horizon (also known as the cosmic light horizon) is larger than that. It can be expressed using the integral

$$
    a(t) H_{p} (t)
    =
    a(t) \int_{0}^{t} \frac{c \, \operatorname{d}t'}{a(t')}
$$
Its present ($t = t_{0}$) value is estimated to be about $46.9$ billion light-years.

The particle horizon has important implications for the observable universe and the cosmic microwave background. Regions of the universe that are separated by distances greater than the particle horizon are not in causal contact, meaning that one region cannot have influenced the other. This is known as the horizon problem, which is one of the motivations for cosmic inflation.
