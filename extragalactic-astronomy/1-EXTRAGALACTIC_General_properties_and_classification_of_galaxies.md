# 1. General properties and classification of galaxies
Galaxies are vast assemblies of stars, gas, dust, and dark matter, bound together by gravity. They are the fundamental building blocks of the Universe, and their study provides insights into a wide range of astrophysical phenomena, from stellar evolution to cosmology. Galaxies come in a variety of shapes and sizes, from dwarf galaxies with just a few million stars to giant elliptical and spiral galaxies with trillions of stars.

The study of galaxies involves understanding their structure, the physical processes occurring within them, their interactions with each other, and their overall role in the Universe. This includes understanding their formation and evolution, the nature of dark matter, the role of supermassive black holes in galaxy evolution, and the chemical enrichment of galaxies over cosmic time.

One of the first steps in studying galaxies is to classify them based on their observable properties. This is important because the classification can provide clues about a galaxy's history, its current state, and its future evolution. The classification of galaxies is based on their morphology (shape and structure), their spectral characteristics, and their activity.

## 1.1. Galaxy classification schemes
The classification of galaxies provides a framework for understanding the diverse range of galaxy properties and their evolution. The most widely used classification schemes are the Hubble sequence and the de Vaucouleurs system.

### 1.1.1. Hubble Sequence
The Hubble sequence, also known as the Hubble tuning fork diagram, classifies galaxies based on their visual appearance (morphology) into three main types: ellipticals, spirals, and lenticulars.

- **Elliptical galaxies (*E*)**: These galaxies are round to elliptical in shape, with smooth, featureless light distributions. They contain very little cool gas and dust, have few young stars, and are dominated by old, red stars. Elliptical galaxies are further classified based on their ellipticity, from *E0* (nearly spherical) to *E7* (highly elongated).
- **Spiral galaxies (*S*)**: These galaxies have a flat, rotating disk of stars and gas, with a central bulge of older stars. The disk is often marked by spiral arms - regions of higher density where star formation is active. Spiral galaxies are further divided into normal spirals (*S*) and barred spirals (*SB*), depending on whether or not they have a bar-like structure extending from the central bulge. Spiral galaxies are further classified into subtypes *a*, *b*, and *c*, based on the prominence and structure of the central bulge and the tightness and definition of the spiral arms. *Sa* and *SBa* galaxies have a large, bright central bulge and tightly wound, smooth spiral arms. *Sb* and *SBb* galaxies have a more moderate-sized bulge and somewhat looser spiral arms. *Sc* and *SBc* galaxies have a small, dim central bulge and loosely wound, well-defined spiral arms.
- **Lenticular galaxies (*S0*)**: These galaxies are a transition type between ellipticals and spirals. They have a disk and a bulge like spirals, but like ellipticals, they have little cool gas and dust and no spiral arms.

### 1.1.2. De Vaucouleurs System
The de Vaucouleurs system is an extension of the Hubble sequence. It recognizes the complexity of galaxy structures and includes more categories. It uses a three-dimensional classification scheme, where the three parameters are:

- **Family**: This is similar to Hubble's basic division into ellipticals, lenticulars, and spirals, and it also includes a bar classification (*SA*, *SAB*, *SB*) for spirals.
- **Variety**: This refers to the presence of a ring or lens feature in the galaxy. Rings are designated by $(r)$, while lenses are designated by $(s)$.
- **Numerical Hubble stage**: This is similar to Hubble's *a*, *b*, *c* division for spirals, but it also includes stages for ellipticals and lenticulars. The stage is indicated by a number from $-5$ to $10$, where $-5$ to $-4$ are ellipticals, $-3$ to $-1$ is lenticular, $0$ is the transition between lenticular and spiral, $1$ to $7$ are spirals, with the spiral arms becoming looser as the number increases, $8$ is the transition between spiral and irregular, and $9$ and $10$ are irregulars.

For example, a galaxy classified as *SAB(rs)c* in the de Vaucouleurs system is a spiral galaxy with a weak bar, a ring, and loosely wound spiral arms.

## 1.2. Components of galaxies
### 1.2.1. Disk
The disk is a defining feature of spiral galaxies, characterized by its thin, flat structure that extends out from the galactic center. This structure is a result of the coordinated motion of its constituent stars, which follow nearly circular orbits around the galaxy's center in the same direction. This ordered rotation is a distinguishing feature of disk galaxies and contrasts with the random stellar motions typically found in elliptical galaxies.

The disk is not just a collection of stars. It's a dynamic, active component of the galaxy where various astrophysical processes take place. One of the most important of these processes is star formation. The disk contains a significant amount of interstellar medium (ISM), composed of atomic and molecular gas and dust. This ISM is the raw material for star formation. When regions of the ISM become dense enough, often due to gravitational instabilities or the passage of a density wave, they can collapse under their own gravity to form new stars.

The stellar population of the disk is diverse, with both old and young stars. However, the younger, blue stars are generally found in the spiral arms, regions of higher density in the disk where star formation is currently taking place or has recently occurred. These spiral arms are not static structures but are thought to be the result of density waves that move through the disk, compressing the ISM and triggering star formation.

The disk also plays a crucial role in the evolution of a galaxy. The processes of star formation and stellar evolution within the disk contribute to the chemical enrichment of the ISM, as stars produce heavier elements through nuclear fusion and then return this material to the ISM through stellar winds and supernova explosions. Over time, this leads to an increase in the metallicity of the disk. Furthermore, the disk can grow in size over time through the accretion of gas from the galaxy's surroundings.

### 1.2.2. Bulge
In the heart of a galaxy, particularly in spiral and lenticular galaxies, resides a densely packed, spheroidal component known as the bulge. This central structure stands distinct from the disk, not just in its shape, but also in its stellar population and kinematics.

The bulge exhibits a spheroidal or ellipsoidal shape, a testament to the random, elliptical orbits of its constituent stars. This kinematic behavior starkly contrasts with the ordered, nearly circular orbits of stars in the disk, and it is this difference that gives the bulge its characteristic shape and broad velocity dispersion.

Peering into the bulge reveals a stellar population that is typically older and more evolved than that of the disk. The stars here often exhibit a reddish hue and low metallicity, suggesting that they were born early in the galaxy's history, before the interstellar medium was significantly enriched with heavier elements. However, the bulge is not a monolithic entity and can harbor complexity in its stellar population. Some bulges, particularly in spiral galaxies, may contain a mix of younger, metal-rich stars, hinting at a more complex formation and evolutionary history.

The role of the bulge in the life story of a galaxy is significant. Its formation is thought to be intertwined with the galaxy's birth and evolution. Theories of bulge formation range from the early collapse of a large gas cloud to the merging of smaller galaxies, and even to disk instabilities that funnel gas and stars towards the galactic center. Each of these scenarios leaves distinct imprints on the bulge's structure, stellar population, and kinematics, making the study of bulges a key to unlocking the history of galaxies. However, the bulge is not just a passive component of the galaxy. Its gravitational influence contributes to the stability of the disk and can shape the formation and evolution of spiral arms, thereby playing an active role in the galaxy's dynamical evolution.

### 1.2.3. Halo
Enveloping the visible components of a galaxy, the halo is an expansive, roughly spherical region that plays a pivotal role in the dynamics and evolution of a galaxy. Unlike the disk and the bulge, the halo is not easily observable due to its diffuse nature and the faintness of its constituents. However, its presence is inferred from its gravitational influence and the motion of objects within the galaxy.

The halo is a vast reservoir of dark matter, the mysterious substance that does not emit or interact with light but exerts gravitational force. Dark matter is thought to make up the bulk of a galaxy's mass, and its distribution within the halo influences the rotation of the galaxy and the orbits of its constituent stars and gas. This shape of this dark matter halo is often approximated by a spherical or ellipsoidal distribution, with the density decreasing with distance from the galaxy's center. It can be described by a density profile, such as the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile

$$
    \varrho(r)
    =
    \frac{\varrho_{0}}{\frac{r}{R_{s}}\left(1 + \frac{r}{R_{s}}\right)^2}
$$

where $\varrho_{0}$ is the characteristic density and $R_{s}$ is the scale radius. The NFW profile is a good fit to the dark matter halos of galaxies and galaxy clusters, and it is often used to describe the dark matter halos of simulated galaxies.

Interspersed within this dark matter are globular clusters, dense, spherical collections of stars that orbit the galaxy's center. These clusters are among the oldest objects in the universe, and their distribution, ages, and chemical compositions provide valuable insights into the formation and evolution of their host galaxy.

It also hosts a sparse population of individual stars, often referred to as the stellar halo. These stars are typically old and metal-poor, suggesting they formed in the early stages of the galaxy's history. Some of these stars may have been accreted from smaller galaxies that were gravitationally disrupted as they ventured too close to the galaxy.

The halo's influence extends beyond its physical boundaries. Its gravitational pull affects the dynamics of the inner parts of the galaxy, including the formation and evolution of the disk and the bulge. Moreover, the halo plays a crucial role in the accretion of matter onto the galaxy and in interactions with other galaxies.

### 1.2.4. Central SMBH
At the heart of most, if not all, galaxies lies a supermassive black hole (SMBH). These objects, despite being invisible to direct observation, exert a profound influence on their host galaxies.

A black hole is a region in space where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from it. The "supermassive" descriptor indicates that these black holes have masses millions to billions of times greater than that of our Sun. The presence of a SMBH is inferred from its gravitational effects on nearby stars and gas, as well as from the energetic phenomena that occur in its vicinity.

The SMBH resides in the very center of a galaxy, typically within the bulge. The stars in the central region of the galaxy move at high speeds due to the strong gravitational pull of the SMBH. By observing these rapid stellar motions, astronomers can estimate the mass of the SMBH.

The influence of the SMBH extends well beyond the central region of the galaxy. It plays a crucial role in the evolution of the galaxy through its interactions with the surrounding gas. When gas falls towards the SMBH, it forms an accretion disk around the black hole. The gravitational energy of the infalling gas is converted into heat and light, often outshining all the stars in the galaxy and creating what is known as an active galactic nucleus (AGN). The energy and jets of particles released by the AGN can heat up and push out the gas in the galaxy, thereby regulating star formation.

The study of SMBHs is not only important for understanding individual galaxies, but also for exploring fundamental questions in physics, such as the nature of gravity and the behavior of matter under extreme conditions.

## 1.3. Galaxy properties
### 1.3.1. Size
The spatial size is obviously a fundamental physical property of all stellar objects in the universe. The exact size of a galaxy can even provide direct insights into its formation and evolution. However, measuring the size of any galaxies is not straightforward due to their diffuse nature and the presence of various components such as the disk, bulge, and halo.

The size of a galaxy is typically characterized by its radius, which is often defined in terms of the visible or luminous components of the galaxy. For a spiral galaxy, this could be the radius of the disk or the extent of the spiral arms. For an elliptical galaxy, the size is often defined by the radius at which the brightness falls to a certain lower threashold.

However, the visible part of a galaxy is just the tip of the iceberg. The halo of a galaxy, which is composed mainly of dark matter, extends much further than the visible components. While the halo is difficult to observe directly, its presence can be inferred from its gravitational effects on the motion of stars and gas in the galaxy, as well as on the light from more distant galaxies (gravitational lensing).

The size of a galaxy can also be influenced by its environment and its interactions with other galaxies. For example, a galaxy in a dense cluster may have its outer parts stripped away by gravitational interactions with other galaxies, reducing its size.

### 1.3.2. Mass
Another fundamental property of a galaxy is its mass that also influences virtually every processes occurring within it. When we talk about "mass" of the galaxy, it includes the mass of all the components: stars, gas, dust, and dark matter.

The mass of the visible matter in a galaxy, such as stars and gas, can be estimated from observations of the light emitted by these components. For example, the mass of the stellar component can be estimated from the galaxy's luminosity (the total amount of light emitted by the stars) and the mass-to-light ratio, which depends on the ages and types of stars in the galaxy.

However, the visible matter makes up only a small fraction of the total mass of a galaxy. The majority of a galaxy's mass is in the form of dark matter, a mysterious substance that does not emit or interact with light but exerts gravitational force. The presence of dark matter is inferred from its gravitational effects on the motion of stars and gas in the galaxy and on the light from more distant galaxies (gravitational lensing).

The total mass of a galaxy, including both visible and dark matter, can be estimated from the motions of stars and gas within the galaxy. Simply by applying Kepler's laws of orbital mechanics the mass within a certain radius can be calculated from the observed velocities and the distance from the center of the galaxy.

### 1.3.3. Luminosity
Luminosity, the total amount of energy emitted by a galaxy per unit time, is a fundamental property of galaxies. It is directly related to the number and types of stars a galaxy contains and provides insights into the galaxy's star formation history and future potential for star formation.

The luminosity of a galaxy is often measured across multiple wavelengths of light, from radio waves to gamma rays. Different wavelengths can reveal different components of the galaxy and different physical processes. For example, ultraviolet light is emitted by hot, young stars and can indicate regions of active star formation. Infrared light is emitted by dust heated by stars, and radio waves can come from neutral hydrogen gas or from high-energy electrons in magnetic fields.

The distribution of a galaxy's luminosity across different wavelengths is known as its spectral energy distribution (SED). The SED can provide valuable information about the galaxy's stellar population, dust content, and other properties. For example, a galaxy with a lot of ultraviolet and blue light is likely to have many young, hot stars, while a galaxy with more red and infrared light is likely to have older, cooler stars and more dust.

The luminosity of a galaxy can also be influenced by its central supermassive black hole. If the black hole is actively accreting material, it can outshine all the stars in the galaxy and produce a broad spectrum of light, from radio waves to X-rays.

Two important relations in extragalactic astronomy, the Tully-Fisher relation and the Faber-Jackson relation, connect the luminosity of a galaxy with other properties:

- **The Tully-Fisher relation** is an empirical relationship between the luminosity of a spiral galaxy and its maximum rotation velocity. It suggests that more luminous galaxies have higher rotation speeds, which is thought to be due to the greater mass (and hence gravitational pull) of more luminous galaxies.
- **The Faber-Jackson relation** is a similar empirical relationship for elliptical galaxies, relating the luminosity of the galaxy to the velocity dispersion of its stars. The velocity dispersion is a measure of the range of velocities of the stars in the galaxy, and it is related to the mass of the galaxy. More luminous elliptical galaxies have higher velocity dispersions, again suggesting a link between luminosity and mass.

### 1.3.4. Chemical composition
The chemical composition of a galaxy provides crucial insights into its history of star formation and its future potential for creating new stars. It is typically characterized by the abundance of various elements, particularly hydrogen, helium, and "metals" (in astronomical parlance, a "metal" is any element heavier than helium).

Hydrogen and helium are the most abundant elements in the universe, and they are the primary constituents of the interstellar medium (ISM) in a galaxy. These elements were predominantly formed in the Big Bang, and they serve as the raw material for star formation.

"Metals", on the other hand, are produced inside stars through nuclear fusion and are spread into the ISM through stellar winds and supernova explosions. The abundance of metals in a galaxy, often quantified by the "metallicity", is a measure of the cumulative effects of star formation and stellar evolution. A high metallicity indicates that a galaxy has undergone a significant amount of star formation in the past, which has enriched the ISM with metals.

The chemical composition of a galaxy is not uniform. It can vary between different components of the galaxy (e.g., the disk, bulge, and halo) and can also vary within a single component. For example, in the disk of a spiral galaxy, the metallicity is often higher in the central regions and lower in the outer regions. This "metallicity gradient" is thought to reflect the higher rate of star formation in the central regions.

The chemical composition of a galaxy is also related to its mass and luminosity. More massive and more luminous galaxies tend to have higher metallicities. This is known as the "mass-metallicity relation" and is thought to be a result of the more efficient conversion of gas into stars in more massive galaxies.
