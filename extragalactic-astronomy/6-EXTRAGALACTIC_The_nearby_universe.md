# 6. The nearby universe
The "nearby universe" refers to the celestial objects and structures that are relatively close to us on a cosmic scale, typically within a few hundred million light-years. This region encompasses the Local Group, nearby galaxy clusters like the Virgo and Coma clusters, the Local Volume, and the Local Supercluster, all embedded within the broader cosmic web of galaxies and dark matter. This region is a fundamental starting point for our understanding of the universe as it represents our cosmic neighborhood, the part of the universe we can study in the greatest detail with our current observational tools.

Understanding the nearby universe is critical because it serves as a laboratory for testing theories of cosmology, galaxy formation and evolution, and astrophysics. Nearby observations provide key "ground truth" data that underpin our broader understanding of the universe. For example, measurements of distances to nearby galaxies using standard candles like Cepheid variables or Type Ia supernovae are crucial for calibrating the cosmic distance scale, which in turn is essential for constraining cosmological parameters and understanding the evolution of the universe.

Moreover, the nearby universe is interesting because it is varied and dynamic, thus providing a rich set of phenomena to study. It contains a wide range of galaxy types, from spirals like our own Milky Way to elliptical galaxies and irregulars, as well as rich structures like galaxy clusters and filaments. It also exhibits intriguing and unique phenomena such as peculiar velocities – deviations from the Hubble flow, including cases where gravitational attractions are strong enough to cause galaxies to approach us at velocities comparable to, or even exceeding their recessional velocity due to cosmic expansion. These blueshifted galaxies provide key insights into the distribution of matter, both visible and dark, on these scales.

In this chapter, we will delve into the structures and phenomena that characterize the nearby universe, bringing together observations, theory, and numerical simulations to provide a comprehensive picture of our cosmic neighborhood. This understanding will lay the groundwork for our exploration of the broader universe, from the cosmic microwave background to the edge of the observable universe.

## 6.1. The Local Group
The Local Group is a cluster of about $80$ galaxies - most of them dwarf galaxies - spread across approximately $10$ million light-years. The term "local" is used because it is the galaxy group that includes the Milky Way, our own galaxy.

Its dominant members are the Andromeda galaxy (M31), the Milky Way, and the Triangulum galaxy (M33). These are all spiral galaxies. The remainder of the group's members are dwarf galaxies, the largest of which are the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds.

The Local Group's mass is estimated to be somewhere between $(1.29 \pm 0.14) \cdot 10^{12} M_{\odot}$ and $(2.3 \pm 0.7) \cdot 10^{12} M_{\odot}$. Most of this mass ($\approx 80\%$) is dark matter. The distribution of galaxies within the Local Group is not uniform; they tend to congregate into two subgroups, one surrounding the Milky Way and the other surrounding Andromeda. The two subgroups are moving towards each other due to gravitational attraction, with Andromeda and the Milky Way predicted to collide in about $4$ billion years. The Triangulum galaxy is expected to join the merger later.

The observation of the Local Group is extremely valuable source of data in the context of galaxy formation and evolution, as it offers a relatively close-up view of these processes. Key research projects in its study revolve around the nature and distribution of dark matter within the group, the processes and timeline of galaxy formation, and the role of interactions between galaxies in driving their evolution.

## 6.2. Nearby galaxy clusters
Galaxy clusters are the largest gravitationally bound structures in the universe and are key to studying galaxy formation and cosmology. Let's look at three nearby and well-studied examples: the Virgo, Coma, and Perseus clusters.

### 6.2.1. Virgo Cluster
The Virgo Cluster is the nearest galaxy cluster to the Local Group, of its center being at a distance of approximately $54$ million light-years away from us in the constellation Virgo. It contains about $1500$ galaxies, including a diverse range of galaxy types from spirals to ellipticals and lenticulars. It also lies at the heart of the larger Virgo Supercluster, which includes the Local Group.

The cluster's dominant galaxy is the M87, which is famous for its active galactic nucleus and the first ever photographed (supermassive) black hole. Many of the brighter galaxies in this cluster, including the giant elliptical galaxy Messier 87, were discovered in the late 1770s and early 1780s and were included in Charles Messier's catalogue of non-cometary fuzzy objects. They were described by Messier as nebulae without stars, and their true nature was not recognized until the 1920s, when Edwin Hubble came along. The cluster is composed of at least three separate subclumps, with the most massive one being Virgo A, centered on Messier 87. The Virgo Cluster is still forming, with various subgroups and surrounding galaxy clouds in the process of merging to form a larger single cluster​.

### 6.2.2. Coma Cluster
The Coma Cluster (Abell 1656) is a large cluster of galaxies that contains over $1\,000$ identified galaxies with a mean distance from Earth of $321$ million light-years. Although most of the galaxies that inhabit the Coma Cluster are ellipticals with very few spiral galaxies located on its edges. It is also part of the Coma Supercluster, which contains over $3\,000$ galaxies.

The full extent of the cluster was not understood until it was more thoroughly studied in the 1950s, although many of the individual galaxies in the cluster had been identified previously. It was one of the first places where observed gravitational anomalies were considered to be indicative of unobserved mass. Fritz Zwicky suggested in 1933 that the galaxies of the Coma Cluster were moving too fast to be bound together by the visible matter of its galaxies, indicating the presence of "dark matter". About $90\%$ of the mass of the Coma cluster is believed to be in the form of dark matter.​

### 6.2.3. Perseus Cluster
The Perseus Cluster, or Abell 426, is one of the most massive nearby clusters, located about $240$ million light-years away. It's notable for its bright central galaxy, NGC 1275, which hosts an active galactic nucleus. The Perseus Cluster is also a strong X-ray source due to its hot intracluster medium, and it's been the subject of detailed studies with X-ray observatories. These observations have revealed interesting phenomena such as "X-ray cavities" thought to be created by outflows from the active galactic nucleus.

## 6.3. Local Sheet, Local Volume, and Local Supercluster
### 6.3.1. Local Sheet

### 6.3.2. Local Volume
The Local Volume refers to a region of space observed in the Local Volume Legacy (LVL) survey project, extending to a radius of about $35.8$ million light-years from the Milky Way. The LVL project was conducted with the Spitzer Space Telescope, which covered $258$ galaxies within this radius. The covered volume is approximately $1.7$ times larger than the volume of the Local Group, and it includes the Local Sheet and the Local Void. The goal of LVL is to provide insights into two primary processes that shape the growth of galaxies: star formation and its interaction with the interstellar medium. The project assembled a core dataset on star formation and dust, drawing from a range of ancillary data. The key scientific issues addressed by the LVL team include understanding the physical mechanisms underlying dust heating, correlations between far-infrared emission, dust content, and global galaxy properties, as well as probing the temporal variation of star formation as a function of global properties​.

### 6.3.3. Virgo Supercluster
The Virgo Supercluster, also known as the Local Supercluster, is an even larger scale structure that includes the Local Group (which contains the Milky Way), the Virgo Cluster, and many other galaxy groups.
