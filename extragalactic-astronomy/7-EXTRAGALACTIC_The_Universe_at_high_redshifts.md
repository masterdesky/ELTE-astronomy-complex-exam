# 7. The Universe at high redshifts
When exploring the universe at high redshifts, we are essentially looking back in time. The light we observe from distant objects has traveled across the universe for billions of years to reach us, providing a snapshot of the universe as it was when the light was emitted. Therefore, studying the most distant observable objects allows us to probe the early universe and understand its evolution.

## 7.1. Distant galaxies and quasars
Galaxies and quasars serve as our primary sources of information in this endeavor. Galaxies, vast assemblies of stars, gas, dust, and dark matter, are the fundamental building blocks of the universe. Their formation and evolution trace the growth of cosmic structures and the underlying cosmological parameters that govern these processes. By studying galaxies at various redshifts, we can piece together a chronological account of cosmic history.

Quasars, on the other hand, are among the most luminous and energetic phenomena in the universe. Powered by supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies, quasars can outshine their host galaxies and be observed across vast cosmic distances. Their extreme luminosities make them visible even at high redshifts, serving as cosmic beacons that illuminate the distant universe. The light from quasars also interacts with the intergalactic medium, providing valuable information about the distribution and state of matter in the early universe.

Therefore, the study of distant galaxies and quasars forms a cornerstone of high-redshift cosmology, offering invaluable insights into the universe's past and the processes that have shaped its evolution.

### 7.1.1. Detection
The detection of extremely distant objects is a cornerstone of observational cosmology, providing a window into the early universe and the formation and evolution of cosmic structures. These celestial bodies, due to their extreme distances, are inherently faint and small in angular size, making their detection a challenging task. (Even though quasars are among the most luminous objects in the universe, their distance makes them appear faint.) However, advancements in observational technology and techniques have made it possible to probe these distant frontiers of the universe.

Photometric surveys, which measure the intensity of light from celestial objects across different wavelengths, have been instrumental in cataloging the universe's distant constituents. These surveys, such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), have provided a wealth of data, mapping millions of galaxies and quasars. By capturing the light from these objects and splitting it into its constituent colors, these surveys provide a broad-brush picture of the universe, enabling the identification of distant galaxies and quasars based on their unique spectral signatures.

Spectroscopic surveys complement photometric surveys by providing a more detailed view of the universe. By measuring the spectrum of light from celestial objects, these surveys provide rich information about the object's composition, redshift, and other properties. The spectrum of a galaxy or quasar is akin to its fingerprint, revealing details about its age, chemical composition, and the physical processes occurring within it.

Radio surveys, which detect the radio emissions from distant galaxies and quasars, offer another avenue for exploration. These surveys are particularly useful for detecting objects that are obscured in optical wavelengths by dust or other intervening matter. Radio emissions can penetrate these obstructions, providing a view of the universe that is otherwise hidden from view.

### 7.1.2. Properties
Distant galaxies and quasars, being relics from the early universe, possess unique properties that set them apart from their nearby counterparts. One of the most distinguishing - trivial - features of these objects is their high redshift. As the universe expands, the light from these distant objects is stretched, or "redshifted", to longer wavelengths. This redshift is a measure of the distance to the object, with higher redshifts corresponding to greater distances. Thus, observing high-redshift galaxies and quasars is akin to looking back in time, providing a glimpse of the universe in its infancy.

Many distant galaxies host active galactic nuclei (AGN), which are compact regions at the centers of these galaxies that emit prodigious amounts of energy. Quasars are a type of AGN that are among the most luminous and energetic objects in the universe. These cosmic beacons, powered by supermassive black holes at the heart of galaxies, can outshine the rest of the galaxy, making them visible across vast cosmic distances.

Distant galaxies often exhibit high rates of star formation. This period of intense star-forming activity, known as a "starburst", can be triggered by various processes, such as galaxy interactions or gas accretion. The light from these newly formed stars, particularly in the ultraviolet and infrared wavelengths, provides a telltale sign of these star-forming galaxies.

The morphology, or shape, of distant galaxies can differ markedly from that of nearby galaxies. These galaxies often appear more irregular and less structured, likely a reflection of the turbulent cosmic environment of the early universe. This period, characterized by a higher frequency of galaxy interactions and mergers, played a crucial role in shaping galaxies and setting the stage for the universe as we see it today.

## 7.2. Cosmic redshift and cosmic distance ladder
The concept of cosmic redshift is fundamental to our understanding of the universe. As the universe expands, the light traveling through it also expands. This results in an increase in the wavelength of the light, which we perceive as a shift towards the red end of the spectrum, hence the term "redshift". The degree of redshift (z) is given by the formula:

$$
    1 + z = \frac{\lambda_{\text{observed}}}{\lambda_{\text{emitted}}}
$$

where λ_observed is the observed wavelength of the light and λ_emitted is the wavelength at which the light was emitted. The redshift is a dimensionless quantity and can be used to estimate the recessional velocity of the object via Hubble's law:

$$
    cz = H_{0} d
$$

where $c$ is the speed of light, $cz$ is the recessional velocity, $H_{0}$ is Hubble's constant, and $d$ is the distance to the object in megaparsecs. For nearby objects, the redshift is small, and the recessional velocity is proportional to the distance. For objects at cosmological distances, the relationship between redshift and distance becomes more complex due to the effects of the universe's expansion.

The cosmic distance ladder is a suite of techniques used to measure the distances to astronomical objects. These methods are arranged in a "ladder" because each method (each "rung" of the ladder) relies on the previous one for calibration. Here's a brief overview:

1. **Radar ranging**: The first and most direct method is radar ranging, where we bounce radio waves off nearby objects like asteroids or planets and measure the time it takes for the signal to return. This gives us a very accurate measure of the distance.
2. **Stellar parallax**: The next rung is stellar parallax, which is the apparent shift of nearby stars against the background of more distant stars as the Earth orbits the Sun. This method is reliable for stars within a few hundred light-years.
3. **Spectroscopic parallax**: For stars further away, we use spectroscopic parallax. This method involves comparing the apparent brightness of a star with its absolute brightness, which we can estimate from its spectrum. The difference gives us the distance.
4. **Cepheid variables and RR Lyrae stars**: For even greater distances, we use variable stars like Cepheids and RR Lyrae stars. These stars have a period-luminosity relationship that allows us to determine their absolute brightness, and thus their distance.
5. **Type Ia supernovae**: For distances to other galaxies, we use Type Ia supernovae. These are exploding stars that have a standard brightness, allowing us to use them as "standard candles" to measure distances.
6. **Tully-Fisher relation and Faber-Jackson relation**: For even larger scales, we use relationships between the properties of galaxies and their luminosities, such as the Tully-Fisher relation (for spiral galaxies) and the Faber-Jackson relation (for elliptical galaxies).
7. **Hubble-Lemaître law**: Finally, for the largest scales, we use the Hubble-Lemaître law, which relates the redshift of a galaxy to its distance from us.

When we venture into the realm of high redshifts, corresponding to the most distant and earliest observable galaxies and quasars, the Hubble-Lemaître law becomes our primary tool for gauging distances. At these large redshifts, the universe's expansion dominates over other effects, and the redshift of light from distant objects can be directly related to the scale factor of the universe at the time the light was emitted. Thus, the Hubble-Lemaître law provides a crucial link between the observed properties of distant objects and the cosmological parameters that describe the universe's expansion.

## 7.3. Cosmic reionization and first galaxies
The epoch of cosmic reionization, which occurred approximately 700 million years after the Big Bang, represents a significant phase transition in the universe. During this period, the inter-galactic medium (IGM), which was primarily filled with neutral hydrogen, began to ionize due to the formation of the first galaxies[^1]. This process of reionization was spatially inhomogeneous, with fainter galaxies playing a significant role.

The first spectroscopic confirmation of galaxies during this epoch was a group of three galaxies, known as EGS77, at a redshift of $z = 7.7$[^2]. The physical separation among these galaxies was less than $0.7 \operatorname{Mpc}$, and the radius of the ionized bubble of the brightest galaxy was estimated to be about $1.02 \operatorname{Mpc}$. These individual ionized bubbles likely overlapped significantly, forming a large yet localized ionized region, which led to the spatial inhomogeneity in the reionization process.

Interestingly, two of the three galaxies in EGS77 were quite faint in the continuum, indicating that the selection of reionizing sources using their Lyman-$\alpha$ line emission was a successful strategy. One of these galaxies is the faintest spectroscopically confirmed galaxy yet discovered at such high redshifts[^3].

Cosmological simulations indicate that the process of reionization was patchy or spatially inhomogeneous[^4]. This process started when intense UV radiation from individual galaxies or groups of galaxies first ionized their local surroundings, forming local ionized bubbles. These ionized bubbles later grew to fill the entire IGM, marking the end of the reionization process.

Star-forming galaxies at high redshifts are expected to have contributed to the reionization process[^5]. These same galaxies, via their Lyman-$\alpha$ emission, provide a practical tool to study the reionization process and the evolution of neutral hydrogen in the IGM.

## 7.4. Observations of the early universe
The study of the early universe is a rapidly evolving field, with significant advancements in observational techniques and theoretical understanding. Observations of the early universe provide crucial insights into the formation and evolution of galaxies, the nature of dark matter, and the physics of the Big Bang.

### 7.4.1. Galaxy formation and cosmic evolution
Galaxy formation is central to our understanding of cosmic evolution. It is widely accepted that galaxies emerged from the expanding matter background due to gravitational instability of primordial fluctuations[^6]. However, additional physical processes must be understood and implemented in theoretical models before they can be reliably used to interpret observations[^7].

Recent advancements in detecting galaxies that formed only a few hundred million years after the Big Bang have pushed for more sophisticated and detailed studies of early structures[^8]. These observations have helped to build a coherent picture of the Universe in its early stages, including the physics of galaxy formation and the impact that early structures had on large-scale processes such as cosmic reionization and metal enrichment of the intergalactic medium[^9].

### 7.4.2. Observational techniques and discoveries
The discovery of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) by Penzias & Wilson in 1965 was a landmark event in the study of the early universe[^10]. The CMB is the afterglow of the Big Bang and provides a snapshot of the universe when it was just $380\,000$ years old. The CMB has been used to measure the age, composition, and geometry of the universe with unprecedented precision[^11].

In addition to the CMB, other observational techniques have been instrumental in studying the early universe. For instance, the eROSITA X-ray telescope on the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) mission has been used to conduct a survey of the entire sky[^12]. This survey has provided insights into the large-scale structure of the universe and tested cosmological models, including Dark Energy[^13].

Observations of exoplanets have also provided valuable insights into the early universe. For example, the detection of helium in the eroding atmosphere of an exoplanet, WASP-107b, revealed that its atmosphere is extended and eroding, providing a new way to study upper exoplanetary atmospheres[^14].

### 7.4.3. Theoretical predictions and observational confirmations
Theoretical predictions based on Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) have been confirmed by observational data. For example, the improved cross-sections of the nuclear reaction that burns deuterium to create helium-3 have been used to produce theoretical estimates of the primordial baryon density that are in agreement with recent astronomical observations of the CMB[^15][^16].

In conclusion, observations of the early universe have played a pivotal role in advancing our understanding of the universe's origins, evolution, and composition. These observations have confirmed theoretical predictions, tested cosmological models, and provided insights into the nature of dark matter and the physics of the Big Bang.
