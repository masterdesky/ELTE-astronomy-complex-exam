# 8. Mergers and the evolution of galaxies
Galaxy mergers are a common and fundamental process in the universe, shaping both the evolution of galaxies and the large-scale structure of the cosmos. They are a key component of the hierarchical structure formation model, a cornerstone of modern cosmology, which posits that small structures form first and subsequently merge to create larger ones. This process is driven by gravity, the dominant force on cosmic scales.

## 8.1. Galaxy Mergers
Galaxy mergers occur when two or more galaxies, drawn together by their mutual gravitational attraction, collide and coalesce into a single, larger galaxy. This process is not a rare event but a common occurrence in the universe, playing a significant role in shaping the properties and distribution of galaxies we observe today.

This process is complex and involves several stages, each with distinct observational signatures. It begins with the galaxies approaching each other, their shapes starting to distort due to tidal forces. As they come closer, they may pass through each other, triggering intense bursts of star formation and activity in their central supermassive black holes. Eventually, they merge into a single entity, often with a radically different morphology than the original galaxies.

Galaxy mergers also have profound (and dramatic) effects on the galaxies involved. They can trigger starbursts, fuel quasar activity, redistribute and heat gas, and reshape the stellar distribution, transforming spiral galaxies into ellipticals. They also play a crucial role in the growth of galaxies and their supermassive black holes.

Studying galaxy mergers is not only important for understanding the life cycle of galaxies but also for shedding light on the nature of dark matter, the evolution of cosmic structure, and the behavior of gravity on cosmic scales. They are a key piece in the puzzle of how our universe evolved from its smooth state shortly after the Big Bang to the complex, structured cosmos we see today.

### 8.1.1. Stages
The process of a galaxy merger can be divided into several stages:

- **Approach**: The galaxies begin to feel each other's gravitational pull as they come into close proximity. Tidal forces start to distort the shapes of the galaxies, often leading to the formation of tidal tails. The galaxies' relative velocities decrease due to dynamical friction, a process where the galaxies lose momentum and kinetic energy to their surrounding dark matter halos.
- **First passage**: The galaxies pass through each other for the first time. This is often a violent process, with strong gravitational interactions leading to further distortions and the triggering of star formation. The interstellar medium of the galaxies can collide, leading to shock waves that can trigger star formation.
- **Maximum elongation**: After the first passage, the galaxies reach their maximum separation before gravity pulls them back together. The galaxies are often highly distorted at this stage, with long tidal tails.
- **Second passage and merger**: The galaxies come together again and eventually merge. This can lead to a burst of star formation and AGN activity as gas is funneled towards the center of the new galaxy. The supermassive black holes at the centers of the original galaxies can also merge during this stage.
- **Post-merger**: The merged galaxy settles into a new equilibrium state. This can often result in a change in the galaxy's morphology, such as a transformation from a spiral to an elliptical galaxy. The star formation rate often decreases at this stage as the gas supply has been depleted.

### 8.1.2. Simulations
Computer simulations are indispensable tools in the study of galaxy mergers. They allow us to model the complex gravitational interactions and gas dynamics involved in a merger, and to predict the observable consequences of these events.

The N-body problem, which describes the motion of a system of particles under the influence of their mutual gravitational attraction, is a key mathematical framework used in these simulations. In the context of galaxy mergers, each "particle" can represent a star, a group of stars, or a region of interstellar gas.

Hydrodynamical simulations add another layer of complexity by including the effects of gas pressure, cooling, and heating. These simulations can model the star formation and AGN activity triggered by a merger. Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations go a step further by including the effects of magnetic fields, which can play a significant role in the dynamics of the interstellar medium and the process of star formation.

Notable examples of large-scale cosmological simulations that include galaxy mergers are the IllustrisTNG and SIMBA simulations.

- **IllustrisTNG** is a suite of cosmological simulations that model a large volume of the universe, including the effects of gravity, hydrodynamics, magnetic fields, and various astrophysical processes such as star formation, supermassive black hole growth, and feedback from stars and black holes. It has been used to study a wide range of phenomena, including galaxy mergers, the evolution of galaxies, and the distribution of dark matter.
- **SIMBA** is another large-scale cosmological simulation that includes detailed models of galaxy formation and evolution. It includes a novel model for black hole growth and feedback, and has been used to study the impact of black holes on their host galaxies, among other things.

These simulations have provided valuable insights into the process of galaxy mergers and their role in the evolution of galaxies and the universe as a whole.

### 8.1.3. Observational Evidence
Observational evidence for galaxy mergers comes from a variety of sources. Distorted galaxy morphologies, such as tidal tails and bridges, are a direct sign of gravitational interactions. The presence of dual AGN or unusually high star formation rates can also indicate a recent or ongoing merger.

In addition, statistical studies of galaxy populations can provide indirect evidence for mergers. For example, the correlation between galaxy mass and central black hole mass suggests a link between galaxy mergers, black hole growth, and galaxy evolution.

Deep surveys of the sky, such as those conducted by the Hubble Space Telescope, have revealed numerous galaxies in various stages of interaction and merger, providing a visual confirmation of the theoretical predictions and simulations.

## 8.2. Impact of Mergers
Galaxy mergers have a profound impact on the galaxies involved. They can trigger starbursts, fuel quasar activity, redistribute and heat gas, and reshape the stellar distribution, transforming spiral galaxies into ellipticals. They also play a crucial role in the growth of galaxies and their supermassive black holes.

### 8.2.1. Star Formation
One of the most significant impacts of a galaxy merger is the triggering of star formation. As the galaxies approach each other and eventually collide, the gravitational forces involved can cause the gas within the galaxies to become compressed. This compression of the gas can lead to the formation of new stars, a process known as a starburst.

During the early stages of a merger, the star formation is often concentrated in the outer parts of the galaxies. However, as the merger progresses, the star formation can become more centralized, particularly during the final stages of the merger when the galaxies' gas is funneled towards the center of the newly formed galaxy.

The rate of star formation during a merger can be significantly higher than in isolated galaxies. This can lead to a rapid increase in the galaxies' stellar mass and a depletion of their gas reserves. The starburst phase is often short-lived, however, and the star formation rate typically decreases after the merger is complete.

### 8.2.2. AGN activity
Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are extremely luminous sources of radiation found at the centers of some galaxies. They are powered by accretion of matter onto supermassive black holes. Galaxy mergers can significantly influence AGN activity, making this a key area of study in understanding the impact of mergers.

During a galaxy merger, the gravitational interactions can cause a significant amount of gas to be funneled towards the center of the galaxy. This gas can form an accretion disk around the central supermassive black hole. As this gas spirals inwards, it heats up due to friction and gravitational compression, emitting large amounts of radiation. This is the primary mechanism powering AGN.

In some AGN, a portion of this accreted matter doesn't fall into the black hole but is instead ejected in the form of jets. These jets are streams of charged particles that are accelerated to near-light speeds by the intense magnetic fields near the black hole. They can extend for hundreds of thousands of light-years, far beyond the host galaxy, and their interactions with the intergalactic medium can have significant impacts on the large-scale structure of the universe.

The influx of gas towards the central black hole during a merger can significantly increase the AGN's luminosity, leading to what is known as a quasar phase. Quasars are the most luminous AGN and are often associated with galaxy mergers.

The AGN activity can have a significant impact on the host galaxy. The energy output from the AGN, including both the radiation from the accretion disk and the kinetic energy of the jets, can heat and ionize the surrounding gas, inhibiting star formation and leading to what is known as AGN feedback. This feedback can regulate the growth of the galaxy and its black hole, leading to the observed correlations between black hole mass and galaxy properties.

In the final stages of a merger, if both galaxies contain a supermassive black hole, these black holes can also merge, releasing a large amount of energy and potentially leading to observable gravitational waves.

### 8.2.3. Galaxy morphology
Galaxy mergers have a profound impact on the morphology, or shape, of the galaxies involved. The gravitational interactions during a merger can redistribute stars, gas, and dark matter, leading to significant changes in the galaxies' structure.

During the early stages of a merger, the galaxies can become highly distorted due to tidal forces. This can lead to the formation of tidal tails, bridges, and other structures that extend far beyond the galaxies' main bodies. These features are often visible in images of interacting galaxies and provide direct evidence of the ongoing merger.

As the merger progresses, the galaxies' disks can be destroyed, and their stars can be scattered into random orbits. This can lead to a transformation in the galaxies' morphology. For example, spiral galaxies, which have a flat disk and a central bulge, can be transformed into elliptical galaxies, which have a more uniform, spheroidal distribution of stars.

The final morphology of the merged galaxy depends on several factors, including the mass ratio of the merging galaxies, the relative orientation of their disks, and the presence of gas. For example, mergers of galaxies with similar masses, or "major mergers," are more likely to result in elliptical galaxies, while mergers with a large mass ratio, or "minor mergers," can result in distorted spiral galaxies.

The transformation of galaxy morphology during a merger is not just a rearrangement of stars, but also involves changes in the galaxies' color, star formation rate, and gas content. For example, the intense star formation during a merger can deplete the galaxies' gas reserves, leading to a decrease in star formation after the merger and a transition from blue, star-forming spiral galaxies to red, quiescent elliptical galaxies.

## 8.3. Hierarchical structure formation and the role of mergers
The hierarchical structure formation model is a fundamental concept in cosmology, describing how the large-scale structure of the universe evolved from small initial fluctuations in the density of matter shortly after the Big Bang. According to this model, small structures form first, and subsequently merge to create larger ones. This process is driven by gravity, the dominant force on cosmic scales.

Galaxy mergers play a crucial role in this hierarchical structure formation. They are the main mechanism through which galaxies grow and evolve over cosmic time. In the early universe, small galaxy-sized structures, often referred to as "protogalaxies," merged to form larger galaxies. These galaxies then continued to grow by merging with other galaxies, leading to the diverse population of galaxies we see today.

The hierarchical structure formation model is supported by a wide range of observations. For example, deep surveys of the sky reveal a "cosmic web" of galaxies, with large, mature galaxies in dense regions where the cosmic web intersects, and smaller, younger galaxies in less dense regions. This is consistent with the idea that galaxies grow by merging with other galaxies, with more mergers occurring in denser regions.

Furthermore, observations of distant (and therefore early) galaxies show that they are smaller and less structured than nearby (and therefore later) galaxies, consistent with the idea that galaxies grow and evolve over time.

Computer simulations, such as the IllustrisTNG and SIMBA simulations mentioned earlier, also provide strong support for the hierarchical structure formation model. These simulations can reproduce the observed properties and distribution of galaxies, including the effects of galaxy mergers.

## 8.4. Post-merger galaxies: remnants, shells, and tidal dwarfs
After a galaxy merger, the newly formed galaxy and its surroundings bear the scars of the violent event that just took place. These post-merger features provide valuable clues about the merger process and the properties of the progenitor galaxies.

## 8.4.1. Remnants
The most obvious remnant of a galaxy merger is the merged galaxy itself. As discussed earlier, the morphology of the merged galaxy can be significantly different from the progenitor galaxies. For example, a merger of two spiral galaxies can result in an elliptical galaxy.

The merged galaxy can also contain a wealth of substructures, such as shells, streams, and rings, which are remnants of the tidal forces during the merger. These structures can be used to infer the properties of the merger, such as the mass ratio of the progenitor galaxies and the geometry of the merger.

## 8.4.2. Shells
Shells are arc-like structures of stars found in the outskirts of some elliptical galaxies. They are thought to be remnants of galaxy mergers, specifically the result of the radial oscillations of stars in the gravitational potential of the merged galaxy.

Shells can provide valuable information about the merger. For example, the number and spacing of shells can be used to estimate the time since the merger, and the symmetry of the shells can provide clues about the geometry of the merger.

## 8.4.3. Tidal Dwarfs
Tidal dwarf galaxies (TDGs) are small galaxies that can form from the debris ejected during a galaxy merger. They are composed of stars and gas that were originally part of the progenitor galaxies but were stripped out by tidal forces during the merger.

TDGs are interesting for several reasons. First, they are a direct product of galaxy mergers and can therefore provide insights into the merger process. Second, they are composed of "recycled" material and can therefore provide information about the properties of the progenitor galaxies. Finally, they are a potential source of "missing" baryonic matter in the universe.
