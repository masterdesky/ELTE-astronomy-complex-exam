# 4. Interacting galaxies, active galactic nuclei (AGN), and quasars

## 4.1. Galactic interactions
Galactic interactions are a crucial part of the cosmic structure formation and evolution. When galaxies approach each other, their mutual gravitational forces can significantly affect their structures and evolution. These interactions can take several forms, most notably galaxy mergers and tidal interactions.

In the case of galaxy mergers, two or more galaxies combine to form a single galaxy. This process is not a collision in the traditional sense, as the stars within the galaxies pass by each other without direct contact due to the vast distances between them. However, the interstellar medium within the galaxies can collide and compress, leading to regions of intense star formation known as starbursts.

These starbursts can significantly alter the galaxies' structure and composition. For instance, a spiral galaxy merging with another spiral galaxy can result in an elliptical galaxy, characterized by a lack of distinct structure and a relatively uniform, elliptical shape.

Tidal interactions occur when galaxies pass close to each other without merging. The gravitational forces of each galaxy can distort the other, often leading to the formation of long tails of stars and interstellar medium extending from the galaxies, known as tidal tails. These interactions can also lead to the formation of tidal dwarf galaxies in these tails.

Furthermore, these interactions can cause gas and dust to funnel into the galaxies' centers, potentially fueling the supermassive black holes residing there. This can lead to the formation of active galactic nuclei (AGN), which we will discuss in more detail in the next section.

These interactions are not isolated events but are part of the larger cosmic web of matter in the universe. They play a significant role in shaping the universe's large-scale structure and the evolution of individual galaxies.

## 4.2. Active galactic nuclei: types, energy source, accretion disk
AGN are compact regions at the centers of galaxies that emit an enormous amount of energy. This energy output is believed to be primarily due to accretion of matter onto a supermassive black hole at the galaxy's center.

There are several types of AGN, each characterized by different observational features. These include Seyfert galaxies, quasars, and blazars. Seyfert galaxies are typically spiral galaxies with bright, compact nuclei. Quasars (quasi-stellar objects) are the most luminous and distant members of the AGN family. Blazars are a type of AGN that emit highly variable and polarized electromagnetic radiation, thought to be due to a jet of particles moving at relativistic speeds directed towards Earth.

The energy source of AGNs is gravitational. As matter falls towards the supermassive black hole in the center, it forms an accretion disk around it. The gravitational energy and friction of the infalling matter is converted into heat, causing the disk to glow brightly. The innermost regions of the disk can reach temperatures of millions of degrees, causing them to emit X-rays.

The accretion disk is also believed to be responsible for the formation of jets observed in many AGN. The exact mechanism is still a topic of research, but it is thought to involve magnetic fields in the disk and the rotational energy of the black hole. More information on this topic can be found in [chapter 9](../astrophysics/9-ASTROPHYSICS_Accretion_processes_in_astrophysics.md) of the astrophysics section.

## 4.3. Quasars: properties, redshifts, role in galaxy evolution
Quasars, or quasi-stellar objects, are the most energetic and distant members of the AGN family. They are characterized by their extreme luminosity, often outshining their host galaxies, and by their compact, star-like appearance.

Quasars emit energy across the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio waves to X-rays. This broad spectrum emission is thought to originate from an accretion disk around a supermassive black hole, similar to other types of AGN. However, quasars are distinguished by their extreme luminosity, which can be thousands of times greater than an entire galaxy.

One of the key properties of quasars is their high redshifts. Redshift is a measure of the stretching of light due to the expansion of the universe. The high redshifts observed in quasars indicate that they are very distant and, therefore, we are observing them as they were in the early universe. This makes quasars valuable tools for studying the early universe and the formation and evolution of galaxies.

Quasars also play a significant role in galaxy evolution. The energy output from a quasar can have a profound impact on its host galaxy. This energy can heat and disperse the interstellar medium, suppressing star formation and leading to what is known as "quasar feedback". This feedback is thought to be one of the mechanisms that regulate the growth of galaxies and the supermassive black holes at their centers.

## 4.4. Jets and lobes from AGN
Many AGN, including quasars, are observed to have jets of matter shooting out from their centers. These jets are one of the most spectacular phenomena associated with AGN and are a testament to the extreme conditions near supermassive black holes.

The jets are composed of plasma - ionized gas consisting of electrons and protons, along with other atomic nuclei. They are believed to be launched from the vicinity of the black hole, where the accretion disk is located. The exact mechanism of jet formation is still a topic of ongoing research, but it is thought to involve the magnetic fields in the accretion disk and the rotational energy of the black hole.

The magnetic field lines associated with an accretion disk are anchored in the disk but extend outwards, looping back on themselves. The rotation of the disk causes these field lines to twist, forming a magnetic structure often likened to a "spring" or a "helix". This helical magnetic field configuration provides a channel for the plasma to move along.

As the matter in the accretion disk moves and interacts with these magnetic field lines, it can experience a force perpendicular to the field lines due to the Lorentz force. Now, within the disk, the matter is primarily moving tangentially (around the central object), and the magnetic field is mostly radial (from the center outwards) but also extends vertically due to the twisting. The Lorentz force from these components therefore has a significant upward component, pushing matter away from the plane of the disk, forming a jet.

These jets can extend over hundreds of thousands, or even millions, of light-years, far beyond the extent of the host galaxy. As the jets propagate through the intergalactic medium, they can form large structures known as radio lobes. These lobes are regions of diffuse radio emission, and their formation is due to the interaction of the jet with the surrounding medium.

The jets and lobes are significant for several reasons. They carry away a substantial amount of energy from the AGN, influencing the energy balance and evolution of the host galaxy. They also provide a unique laboratory for studying the physics of relativistic plasmas and the extreme environments near black holes.

## 4.5. Unified model of AGN
The Unified Model of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is a theoretical framework that attempts to explain the diverse properties of AGN using a single, underlying structure. According to this model, the differences between various types of AGN (like Seyfert galaxies, quasars, and blazars) are primarily due to the viewing angle from which we observe them, rather than intrinsic differences in their structures.

At the heart of each AGN, according to the unified model, is a supermassive black hole surrounded by an accretion disk. The gravitational energy of matter falling into the black hole is converted into light, producing the intense luminosity characteristic of AGN.

Perpendicular to the accretion disk are the jets of relativistic particles, which are thought to be powered by the black hole's rotational energy and the magnetic fields in the accretion disk. Surrounding the black hole and accretion disk is a thick, dusty torus, which can obscure our view of the central regions when viewed from certain angles.

According to the unified model, when we view the AGN from above or below the torus, we see a type-1 AGN, such as a quasar, where we can directly observe the bright central regions. When viewed from the side, the torus obscures the central regions, and we see a type-2 AGN, such as a Seyfert galaxy.

The unified model has been successful in explaining many observations of AGN, but it is still a topic of ongoing research. Some observations suggest that there may be more to the story, and the model may need to be refined or extended to account for all the complexities of AGN.
