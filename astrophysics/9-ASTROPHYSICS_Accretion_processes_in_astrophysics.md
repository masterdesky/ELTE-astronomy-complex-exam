# 9. Accretion processes in astrophysics

## 9.1. Accretion disks
### 9.1.1. Formation
Accretion disks are formed when matter falls into the gravitational well of a massive object such as a star or a black hole. This process is often facilitated by the loss of angular momentum, which can occur through various processes like friction or magnetic coupling. As the material spirals inward, conservation of angular momentum dictates that it takes on a disk-like shape around the central object. The process is not unlike water spiraling down a drain.

### 9.1.2. Structure and properties
Accretion disks are characterized by a thin, flat structure of rotating matter around a central object, with their physical properties varying radially. The disk's rotation speed increases towards the center due to Kepler's laws of motion, resulting in a hotter, denser inner region and a cooler, less dense outer region.

The temperature and density profiles of an accretion disk largely depend on the characteristics of the central object and the infalling material. The gravitational energy release in the vicinity of compact objects, such as black holes, can lead to extreme heating of the disk's innermost region, with temperatures high enough to emit X-rays.

Radiation processes in accretion disks are primarily driven by frictional heating, as the inward-spiraling material rubs against other material, generating heat. This heat is radiated away in the form of light, with the spectrum of this light providing insights about the conditions within the disk. For instance, the hotter inner parts of the disk primarily emit higher-energy light, such as X-rays, while the cooler outer parts emit lower-energy light, like infrared.

Beyond frictional heating, additional radiation processes can occur depending on the disk's specifics. In magnetically active disks, magnetic reconnection events can generate high-energy particles that emit synchrotron radiation, adding another layer of complexity to the radiation profile of these fascinating astrophysical phenomena.

## 9.2. Accretion onto compact objects
### 9.2.1. White dwarfs
White dwarfs represent the end state of stars with initial masses up to about $8 \, M_{\odot}$. Their high gravity causes them to have strong gravitational pull, which can strip matter from companion stars if they exist in a binary system. This accreted matter typically forms an accretion disk before spiraling onto the white dwarf.

One notable process associated with accretion onto white dwarfs is a cataclysmic variable (CV) phenomenon, where the accreted material can ignite in a thermonuclear explosion on the surface of the white dwarf, leading to a nova outburst. As the white dwarf accretes more and more material, it can eventually reach the Chandrasekhar mass limit ($1.4 \, M_{\odot}$), at which point electron degeneracy pressure can no longer support against the gravitational collapse and the white dwarf explodes in a Type Ia supernova.

### 9.2.2. Neutron stars
Neutron stars, the remnants of supernova explosions of massive stars, are characterized by their extremely high densities and strong magnetic fields. Accretion onto neutron stars often occurs in binary systems, where the neutron star's gravitational pull draws material from its companion star.

As this material gets accreted, it can heat up and emit X-rays, leading to the formation of what we call X-ray binaries. A special type of these are the so-called pulsars, which emit highly collimated beams of radiation due to their strong magnetic fields.

An important parameter in these scenarios is the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff (TOV) limit. This limit represents the maximum mass that a neutron star can attain before it collapses under its own gravity into a black hole. Though the exact value is dependent on the equation of state of neutron star matter (which is still a topic of ongoing research), it's generally believed to be between $2-3 \, M_{\odot}$.

Accretion can potentially increase the mass of a neutron star towards the TOV limit, making it a subject of interest in studies of binary systems where mass transfer is occurring.

### 9.2.3. Black holes
Black holes, the densest objects in the universe, exert such a strong gravitational pull that nothing, not even light, can escape once crossed the event horizon. Accretion onto black holes can lead to the formation of active galactic nuclei (AGN) or X-ray binaries, similar to neutron stars.

The matter spiraling into a black hole forms an accretion disk, and the release of gravitational potential energy heats up this disk to high temperatures, causing it to emit X-rays. The innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) is an important parameter in these systems, as it represents the closest distance that matter can orbit a black hole before falling in. Although in theory, every massive object has a corresponding ISCO in general relativity, its significance is particularly notable in the context of black holes, since these are the only stellar objects that have their ISCO outside their radius.

Rotation of a black hole can effect the ISCO, as the frame-dragging effect of the black hole's rotation can cause it to be closer to the event horizon. This effect is more pronounced for rapidly rotating black holes, which can have their ISCOs as close as the event horizon itself, if $\chi \to 1$.

Observations and measurements of the ISCO can provide insights about the properties of the black hole, such as its mass and spin. The location of the ISCO can leave distinct observational signatures. For example, the X-ray spectra of black hole accretion disks can exhibit a characteristic "bump" or "knee" at energies corresponding to the ISCO, providing a way to infer the black hole's spin.

## 9.3. Jets and outflows
### 9.3.1. Formation
Astrophysical jets are streams of ionized matter that are ejected from some astrophysical objects. The launch process is thought to be caused by magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) mechanisms. Here, the interplay between the magnetic fields, plasma pressure, and rotation creates an outward force that can overcome gravity, leading to the ejection of material in the form of a jet.

The magnetic field lines associated with an accretion disk are anchored in the disk but extend outwards, looping back on themselves. The rotation of the disk causes these field lines to twist, forming a magnetic structure often likened to a "spring" or a "helix". This helical magnetic field configuration provides a channel for the plasma to move along.

As the matter in the accretion disk moves and interacts with these magnetic field lines, it can experience a force perpendicular to the field lines due to the Lorentz force. Now, within the disk, the matter is primarily moving tangentially (around the central object), and the magnetic field is mostly radial (from the center outwards) but also extends vertically due to the twisting. The Lorentz force from these components therefore has a significant upward component, pushing matter away from the plane of the disk.

Additionally, centrifugal forces also play a role. The rotation of the disk not only twists the magnetic field lines into a helical structure, but it also provides a centrifugal force that supports the outward motion of the matter along the field lines.

Together, these factors combine to drive matter away from the accretion disk, along the twisted magnetic field lines, and along the rotation axis of the system. This produces a jet of material that is ejected perpendicularly to the accretion disk.

### 9.3.2. Impact on their surroundings
Astrophysical jets have profound effects on their surroundings. These impacts can range from local to cosmological scales, affecting the evolution of galaxies and clusters of galaxies.

On a local scale, jets can interact with the interstellar medium, creating shock waves and heating the surrounding gas. This can trigger star formation in certain conditions or disrupt it if the jet is particularly powerful.

On larger scales, the radio lobes produced by jets from active galactic nuclei (AGN) can displace huge volumes of gas in galaxy clusters, creating cavities. The energy injected into the intracluster medium by these jets can prevent the cooling and condensation of gas in the cluster's core, thereby influencing the rate of star formation and the evolution of galaxies within the cluster.
