Blackbody radiation is the radiation emitted by a blackbody. The energy density of blackbody radiation is given by

$$
u_{\rm bb} = \frac{8 \pi h}{c^3} \frac{\nu^3}{e^{h \nu / k_B T} - 1} \, ,
$$

where $h$ is the Planck constant, $c$ is the speed of light, $\nu$ is the frequency of the radiation, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the temperature of the blackbody. The energy density of blackbody radiation is also given by

$$
u_{\rm bb} = a T^4 \, ,
$$

where $a$ is the radiation constant. The energy density of blackbody radiation is also given by

$$
u_{\rm bb} = \frac{4 \sigma}{c} T^4 \, ,
$$

where $\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The energy density of blackbody radiation is also given by

$$
u_{\rm bb} = \frac{4 \pi^2 k_B^4}{15 c^3 h^3} T^4 \, .

### 2.2.2. Synchrotron radiation
Synchrotron radiation is the radiation emitted by a charged particle when it is accelerated by a magnetic field. The energy of the emitted photon is given by

$$
E_{\rm ph} = \frac{1}{2} \frac{e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{1}{m_e c^2} \frac{1}{r} \, ,
$$

where $e$ is the electron charge, $\epsilon_0$ is the vacuum permittivity, $m_e$ is the electron mass, $c$ is the speed of light, and $r$ is the distance between the two charged particles. The cross section for synchrotron radiation is given by

$$
\sigma_{\rm syn} = \frac{8}{3} \frac{e^4}{(4 \pi \epsilon_0)^2} \frac{1}{m_e^2 c^4} \frac{1}{E_{\rm ph}} \, .
$$

### 2.2.3. Bremsstrahlung radiation
Bremstrahlung radiation is the radiation emitted by a charged particle when it is accelerated by another charged particle. The energy of the emitted photon is given by

$$
E_{\rm ph} = \frac{1}{2} \frac{e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{1}{m_e c^2} \frac{1}{r} \, ,
$$

where $e$ is the electron charge, $\epsilon_0$ is the vacuum permittivity, $m_e$ is the electron mass, $c$ is the speed of light, and $r$ is the distance between the two charged particles. The cross section for bremsstrahlung radiation is given by

$$
\sigma_{\rm br} = \frac{16}{3} \frac{e^6}{(4 \pi \epsilon_0)^2} \frac{1}{m_e^2 c^4} \frac{1}{E_{\rm ph}} \, .
$$

### 2.2.4. Inverse Compton Scattering
Inverse Compton scattering is the scattering of photons off of relativistic electrons. The energy of the scattered photon is increased by a factor of $\gamma^2$ where $\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor of the electron. The energy of the scattered photon is given by

$$
E_{\rm sc} = \frac{4}{3} \gamma^2 E_{\rm ph} \, ,
$$

where $E_{\rm ph}$ is the energy of the incident photon. The cross section for inverse Compton scattering is given by

$$
\sigma_{\rm IC} = \frac{3}{16} \sigma_T \frac{E_{\rm sc}}{E_{\rm ph}} \, ,
$$

where $\sigma_T$ is the Thomson cross section.
