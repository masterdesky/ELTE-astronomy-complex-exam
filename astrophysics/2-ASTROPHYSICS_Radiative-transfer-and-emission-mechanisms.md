### 2.2.1. Blackbody radiation
Blackbody radiation is a continuous spectrum of radiation emitted by an object in thermal equilibrium. It's characterized by the object's temperature, with the peak of the emission shifting to shorter wavelengths as temperature increases (Wien's Displacement Law) and the total energy emitted increasing with the fourth power of the temperature (Stefan-Boltzmann Law). The spectral radiance of the blackbody radiation is given by the Planck's law as

$$
B_{\nu} = \frac{2 h \nu^3}{c^2} \frac{1}{\exp \left( \frac{h \nu}{k_B T} \right) - 1} \, ,
$$

where $h$ is the Planck constant, $c$ is the speed of light, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $\nu$ is the frequency of the radiation, and $T$ is the temperature of the object.

### 2.2.2. Synchrotron radiation
Synchrotron radiation is emitted when charged particles are accelerated radially, i.e., when they are subject to an acceleration perpendicular to their velocity. It is produced, for example, in synchrotrons using bending magnets, undulators and/or wigglers. In astrophysics, synchrotron radiation from high-energy electrons spiraling around magnetic field lines is a major source of radio emission in a variety of objects, including supernova remnants and active galactic nuclei. The energy of the emitted photon is given by

$$
E_{\rm ph} = \frac{1}{2} \frac{e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{1}{m_e c^2} \frac{1}{r} \, ,
$$

where $e$ is the electron charge, $\epsilon_0$ is the vacuum permittivity, $m_e$ is the electron mass, $c$ is the speed of light, and $r$ is the distance between the two charged particles. The cross section for synchrotron radiation is given by

$$
\sigma_{\rm syn} = \frac{8}{3} \frac{e^4}{(4 \pi \epsilon_0)^2} \frac{1}{m_e^2 c^4} \frac{1}{E_{\rm ph}} \, .
$$

### 2.2.3. Bremsstrahlung radiation
Bremsstrahlung radiation is produced by the acceleration or deceleration of a charged particle, usually an electron, in the electric field of another charged particle, such as an atomic nucleus. The radiation is continuous because the energy of the emitted photon can take on any value up to the kinetic energy of the particle. The energy of the emitted photon is given by

$$
E_{\rm ph} = \frac{1}{2} \frac{e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{1}{m_e c^2} \frac{1}{r} \, ,
$$

where $e$ is the electron charge, $\epsilon_0$ is the vacuum permittivity, $m_e$ is the electron mass, $c$ is the speed of light, and $r$ is the distance between the two charged particles. The cross section for bremsstrahlung radiation is given by

$$
\sigma_{\rm br} = \frac{16}{3} \frac{e^6}{(4 \pi \epsilon_0)^2} \frac{1}{m_e^2 c^4} \frac{1}{E_{\rm ph}} \, .
$$

### 2.2.4. Inverse Compton Scattering
Inverse Compton scattering is the scattering of photons off of relativistic electrons. The energy of the scattered photon is increased by a factor of $\gamma^2$ where $\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor of the electron. The energy of the scattered photon is given by

$$
E_{\rm sc} = \frac{4}{3} \gamma^2 E_{\rm ph} \, ,
$$

where $E_{\rm ph}$ is the energy of the incident photon. The cross section for inverse Compton scattering is given by

$$
\sigma_{\rm IC} = \frac{3}{16} \sigma_T \frac{E_{\rm sc}}{E_{\rm ph}} \, ,
$$

where $\sigma_T$ is the Thomson cross section.
