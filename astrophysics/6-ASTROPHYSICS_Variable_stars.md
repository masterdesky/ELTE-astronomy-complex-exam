# 6. Variable stars

## 6.1. Types of variable stars
Variable stars are stars that experience changes in their brightness over time. These changes can be due to intrinsic factors, such as pulsations within the star itself, or extrinsic factors, such as the star being part of a binary system where one star eclipses the other.

There are several types of variable stars, each with unique characteristics. They can be categorized into two larger groups based on whether internal or external factors cause their variability.

1. Intrinsic variable stars:
   - **Pulsating variables**: These stars expand and contract, leading to changes in their brightness. Examples include Cepheids and RR Lyrae stars.
   - **Eruptive variables**: These stars experience sudden outbursts of brightness due to eruptions of material from their surface.
   - **Cataclysmic variables**: The variability of these stars is due to a sudden, catastrophic event, such as a nova or supernova.

2. Extrinsic variable stars:
   - **Eclipsing binaries**: These are binary star systems where the orbital plane is nearly in line with our line of sight. As a result, the stars eclipse each other, leading to changes in the system's overall brightness.
   - **Rotating variables**: These stars have spots or other features that cause their brightness to change as they rotate.

3. Other types:
   - **Semi-regular variables**: These stars have a regular period of variability, but the changes in brightness are not as regular as those of pulsating variables.
   - **Irregular variables**: These stars do not have a regular period of variability. Their changes in brightness can be unpredictable.


## 6.2. Pulsating variables
Pulsating variable stars are stars that vary in brightness due to periodic expansion and contraction of their outer layers. This pulsation is driven by processes deep within the star, related to the balance between gravitational forces and the pressure of the star's gases.

### 6.2.1. Cepheids
Cepheid variable stars are a type of pulsating variable star. They are named after the prototype star, Delta Cephei. Cepheids are highly luminous supergiant or giant stars, and they play a crucial role in the cosmic distance ladder due to their period-luminosity relationship.

The period-luminosity relationship, discovered by Henrietta Swan Leavitt, states that the brighter a Cepheid variable star is, the longer its period of pulsation. This relationship allows astronomers to determine the distance to Cepheids (and thus to galaxies containing Cepheids) by observing their pulsation period and comparing it to their apparent brightness.

Cepheids pulsate due to a mechanism known as the kappa mechanism, where a layer in the star's interior, partially ionized helium in this case, becomes more or less opaque as it is compressed and decompressed, driving a self-sustaining cycle of expansion and contraction.

### 6.2.2. RR Lyrae
RR Lyrae stars are another type of pulsating variable stars, named after the prototype star, RR Lyrae. They are typically found in older populations of stars, such as globular clusters, and are less luminous than Cepheids.

RR Lyrae stars have periods of pulsation that are less than a day, typically around $0.5$ days, and they have a nearly constant average luminosity. This makes them "standard candles" for distance estimation, similar to Cepheids, but their shorter periods and lower luminosities make them useful for studying nearby, older populations of stars.

The pulsations of RR Lyrae stars are also driven by the kappa mechanism, but in their case, it involves the ionization of hydrogen instead of helium. This is due to their lower masses and temperatures compared to Cepheids.

## 6.3. Eruptive variables
Eruptive variable stars are stars that exhibit changes in brightness due to violent processes occurring on their surfaces or in their immediate surroundings. These changes can be sporadic and unpredictable, and they can last from a few days to several years.

There are several types of eruptive variables, including:

- **Protostars**: These are young stars in the process of formation. They can exhibit variability in brightness due to accretion of material from the surrounding nebula, or due to internal processes as the star evolves towards the main sequence.
- **Flare stars**: These are typically small, dim stars (often red dwarfs) that can suddenly increase in brightness due to powerful magnetic activity on their surfaces. This magnetic activity can cause flares that increase the star's brightness by several magnitudes for a few minutes to a few hours.
- **Luminous blue variables (LBVs)**: These are massive, luminous stars that exhibit irregular variations in brightness. These variations are thought to be due to instabilities in the star's outer layers, which can lead to powerful outbursts that eject material into space.
- **Wolf-Rayet variables**: These are extremely hot, luminous stars that are losing mass rapidly due to strong stellar winds. Their variability is thought to be due to changes in their wind structure, or due to the presence of a binary companion.

## 6.4. Cataclysmic variables
Cataclysmic variable stars are binary star systems where a white dwarf star accretes matter from a companion star. This accretion process can lead to dramatic and often violent changes in brightness. There are several types of cataclysmic variables, including novae and supernovae.

### 6.4.1. Novae
A nova is a type of cataclysmic variable star where a white dwarf accretes matter from a companion star, usually a red giant or a main sequence star. As the matter accumulates on the white dwarf's surface, it gets compressed and heated until it reaches a temperature where hydrogen fusion can occur. This leads to a thermonuclear explosion on the surface of the white dwarf, causing a sudden increase in brightness.

Novae are not usually destructive to the white dwarf or its companion, and the process can repeat itself over periods ranging from years to tens of thousands of years. The material ejected in the explosion can form a shell or nebula around the star, which can be observed for several years after the event.

### 6.4.2. Supernovae
Supernovae are the most violent type of cataclysmic variable and one of the most energetic events in the universe. They occur in two main types:

1. **Type Ia Supernovae**: This type occurs in a binary system where a white dwarf accretes matter from a companion until it reaches a critical mass (the Chandrasekhar limit), leading to a runaway nuclear fusion reaction that completely disrupts the white dwarf. Type Ia supernovae are important cosmological distance indicators because their peak luminosities are remarkably uniform.
2. **Core-collapse Supernovae (Type II, Ib, Ic)**: These occur when a massive star exhausts its nuclear fuel and the core collapses under gravity, leading to a violent explosion. These supernovae are often associated with long-duration gamma-ray bursts and are the primary source of elements heavier than iron in the universe.

## 6.5. Eclipsing binaries
Eclipsing binary stars are a type of binary star system where the orbital plane is nearly in line with our line of sight. This means that, from our perspective, the stars pass in front of each other, or "eclipse" each other, during each orbit.

As one star passes in front of the other, it blocks some of the other star's light, causing the total brightness of the system to decrease. This decrease is temporary and the brightness returns to normal once the eclipse is over. By observing these changes in brightness, astronomers can learn a lot about the stars, including their sizes, masses, and the shape of their orbits.

There are two main types of eclipses in these systems:
- **Primary eclipse**: This occurs when the brighter star is eclipsed by the dimmer one. This results in a larger decrease in brightness.
- **Secondary eclipse**: This occurs when the dimmer star is eclipsed by the brighter one. This results in a smaller decrease in brightness.

Eclipsing binaries are important because they allow for direct measurement of stellar masses and radii, which are crucial for testing theories of stellar structure and evolution.

## 6.6. Rotating variables
Rotating variable stars are stars whose brightness varies as they rotate. This variability is typically due to one or more of the following factors:

- **Starspots**: Similar to sunspots on the Sun, starspots are cooler, darker areas on the star's surface. As the star rotates, these spots move in and out of view, causing the star's brightness to vary.
- **Ellipsoidal variations**: If a star is part of a close binary system, tidal forces from its companion can distort it into an ellipsoidal shape. As the star rotates, we see different cross-sections of the star, causing its apparent brightness to vary.
- **Differential rotation and magnetic activity**: Some stars, like our Sun, exhibit differential rotation, where the equator rotates faster than the poles. This can lead to complex magnetic activity and variability in brightness.
- **Chemical inhomogeneities**: In some stars, particularly chemically peculiar stars, different elements can be concentrated in different areas of the star's surface. As the star rotates, these areas move in and out of view, causing the star's spectrum and brightness to vary.
