# 5. Nucleosynthesis and stellar evolution
The energy source that powers stars and enables them to shine brightly for billions of years is nuclear fusion. This is a process where atomic nuclei combine, or "fuse," to form a heavier nucleus, and in the process release energy. While the exact details and dominant process depend on the mass and temperature of the star, these nuclear fusion reactions are the key energy source that enables stars to shine over astronomically long timescales.

## 5.1. Proton-proton chain
The primary nuclear fusion process in stars like the Sun is the proton-proton chain. This process involves the combination of hydrogen nuclei (protons) to form helium, with several steps:

1. Two protons combine to form a deuterium nucleus (a proton and a neutron), a positron, and a neutrino:
$$
    p^{+} + p^{+}
    \to
    d^{+} + e^{+} + \nu_{e}
$$

2. The deuterium nucleus then combines with another proton to form a $\operatorname{He}^{3}$ nucleus:
$$
    d^{+} + p^{+}
    \to
    \operatorname{He}^{3} + Î³
$$

3. Finally, two $\operatorname{He}^{3}$ nuclei combine to form $\operatorname{He}^{4}$, releasing two protons in the process:
$$
    \operatorname{He}^{3} + \operatorname{He}^{3}
    \to
    \operatorname{He}^{4} + p^{+} + p^{+}
$$

In this process, some mass is converted into energy, as described by Einstein's famous equation $E=mc^{2}$. The energy released in the form of gamma-ray photons ($\gamma$) eventually reaches the surface of the star and is emitted as light.

## 5.2. CNO cycle
The CNO (carbon-nitrogen-oxygen) cycle is a competing nuclear fusion process that is more efficient than the proton-proton chain at higher temperatures. In stars heavier than $1.3 M_{\odot}$, it becomes the primary energy generation process. The CNO cycle involves protons combining with carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen nuclei to form helium. This process is a cycle rather than a chain, with the heavy nuclei acting as catalysts and being regenerated at the end of the cycle.

The basic CNO cycle involves these reactions:

1. $\operatorname{C}^{12}$ captures a proton to form $\operatorname{N}^{13}$:
$$
    \operatorname{C}^{12} + p^{+} \to \operatorname{N}^{13}
$$

2. $\operatorname{N}^{13}$ undergoes beta decay to form $\operatorname{C}^{13}$:
$$
    \operatorname{N}^{13} \to \operatorname{C}^{13} + e^{+} + \nu_{e}
$$

3. $\operatorname{C}^{13}$ captures a proton to form $\operatorname{N}^{14}$:
$$
    \operatorname{C}^{13} + p^{+} \to \operatorname{N}^{14}
$$

4. $\operatorname{N}^{14}$ captures a proton to form $\operatorname{C}^{15}$:
$$
    \operatorname{N}^{14} + p^{+} \to \operatorname{C}^{15}
$$

5. $\operatorname{C}^{15}$ undergoes beta decay to form $\operatorname{N}^{15}$:
$$
    \operatorname{C}^{15} \to \operatorname{N}^{15} + e^{+} + \nu_{e}
$$

6. $\operatorname{N}^{15}$ captures a proton and releases a helium-4 nucleus, regenerating the initial $\operatorname{C}^{12}$ nucleus:
$$
    \operatorname{N}^{15} + p^{+} \to \operatorname{C}^{12} + \operatorname{He}^{4}
$$

The net effect of the CNO cycle, like the p-p chain, is to convert hydrogen into helium, with a release of energy.

## 5.3. Supernova nucleosynthesis and neutron star mergers
In the lifetime of a star, there are stages beyond the fusion of hydrogen into helium. As stars exhaust their hydrogen fuel, they begin to fuse helium and other heavier elements. In stars heavier than $8 M_{\odot}$, this process continues up to the production of iron in their cores.

Fusion reactions in stars produce energy due to the nature of nuclear binding energy, which is the energy required to keep protons and neutrons together in an atomic nucleus. The binding energy per nucleon is not constant across different elements, but instead follows a curve that reaches a peak at around iron and nickel (at $\operatorname{Fe}^{56}$ to be precise).

In elements lighter than that, the fusion of smaller atomic nuclei results in a nucleus closer to iron on the binding energy curve. This new nucleus has a higher binding energy per nucleon, meaning it is more tightly bound and lower in energy. This difference in energy is released during the fusion process, which is what powers the star.

On the other hand, in elements heavier than iron, the process to reach a state of lower energy would involve breaking apart the nucleus (fission), not combining them.

Because of this, the fusion of iron does not produce energy anymore, and the core collapses, leading to a supernova explosion. This violent event results in what we call supernova nucleosynthesis.

### 5.3.1. Supernova nucleosynthesis
Supernova nucleosynthesis is the process that occurs during a supernova explosion where the conditions of temperature and pressure are extreme enough to allow the formation of elements heavier than iron.

In a supernova explosion, the outer layers of the star are ejected, and the core collapses, reaching temperatures of billions of degrees. Under these extreme conditions, a large number of neutrons are produced, which can be captured by atomic nuclei, leading to the formation of heavy and rare elements like gold, uranium, and other elements beyond iron in the periodic table. This process is called the $r$-process, or rapid neutron capture process.

The ejected material, enriched with heavy elements, eventually mixes with the interstellar medium, contributing to the chemical evolution of the galaxy.

### 5.3.2. Neutron Star mergers
Neutron star mergers are another key site for the production of heavy elements. Neutron stars are the remnants of supernovae and are incredibly dense objects composed mostly of neutrons. When two neutron stars orbit each other, they lose energy through gravitational wave radiation and eventually merge in a violent event that is among the most energetic phenomena in the universe.

During the merger, a significant fraction of the neutron stars' mass is ejected. This ejected material, which is rich in neutrons, provides the perfect conditions for the $r$-process, leading to the formation of heavy elements. Recent observations of gravitational waves from neutron star mergers, accompanied by a kilonova (an optical and infrared glow from the radioactive decay of heavy elements), provide strong evidence for this process.

## 5.4. Main sequence stars and stellar clusters
Once nuclear fusion is ignited inside a star's core and it stabilized, it enters the longest phase of its life - the main sequence phase. Main sequence stars are in a state of hydrostatic equilibrium, where the outward pressure from the energy produced by nuclear fusion in the core balances the inward pull of gravity. The length of time a star stays in this stage, as well as its ultimate fate, is determined primarily by its initial mass.

### 4.4.1. Main Sequence Stars
The properties of a main sequence star, such as its luminosity, surface temperature, and lifespan, are primarily determined by its mass. Stars with higher mass have shorter main sequence lifetimes due to their higher core temperatures and faster fusion rates. On the other hand, lower mass stars, like our Sun, have longer lifetimes as they burn their fuel more slowly. The Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) diagram is a useful tool for visualizing the relationship between the luminosity and temperature of main sequence stars.

### 4.4.2. Stellar Clusters
Stars are not solitary entities, they often form in groups known as stellar clusters. These clusters are broadly categorized into two types: open clusters and globular clusters. Open clusters, which are generally found in the disk of a galaxy, contain a few hundred to a few thousand stars that were born from the same molecular cloud. Globular clusters, on the other hand, are densely packed spherical collections of stars that orbit the center of a galaxy.

Studying stellar clusters is crucial in astrophysics as they provide insights into star formation and evolution, the age of the universe, and the properties of the galaxies they inhabit.

## 5.5. The ultimate fate of stars
### 5.5.1. Low-mass stars
Stars with masses less than about $0.5 M_{\odot}$ are considered low-mass stars. They burn their hydrogen fuel very slowly and can remain in the main sequence stage for hundreds of billions of years, far longer than the current age of the universe.

When they exhaust their hydrogen fuel, these stars do not have sufficient gravity to ignite helium fusion. Instead, they become helium white dwarfs, fading away slowly as they radiate away their residual heat.

### 5.5.2. Intermediate-mass stars
Stars with masses between about $0.5 M_{\odot}$ and $8 M_{\odot}$ are considered intermediate-mass stars. Our Sun is an example of this category. These stars burn through their hydrogen fuel in a few billion to tens of billions of years.

When the hydrogen in the core is exhausted, these stars start to fuse helium into carbon and oxygen in their core, becoming red giants in the process. Eventually, the core becomes a mix of carbon and oxygen, which does not ignite in stars of this mass.

The outer layers of the star are ejected as a planetary nebula, and the core becomes a white dwarf. Over billions of years, white dwarfs cool and dim, eventually becoming black dwarfs.

### 5.5.3. High-mass stars
Stars with masses greater than about $8 M_{\odot}$ are considered high-mass stars. They burn through their hydrogen fuel rapidly, in approximately tens of millions of years.

When the hydrogen in the core is exhausted, these stars can fuse increasingly heavier elements in their cores, up to iron. When the core becomes iron, fusion no longer generates energy, and the core collapses under its own gravity, resulting in a supernova explosion.

The remnant of the supernova can become a neutron star or, if the original star was massive enough, a black hole.

### 5.5.4. Super-heavy stars
Stars with masses greater than about $100 M_{\odot}$ are considered super-heavy stars. Due to the incredibly high pressures and temperatures at their cores they burn through their nuclear fuel fuel in a few million years, which is extremely brief compared to the billions of years that stars like the Sun live. This fast energy generation leads to strong radiation pressure that can cause the star to lose a significant fraction of its mass over its (very short) lifetime in a strong stellar wind.

When it comes to their death, there are a few possible outcomes, and the exact details are still an active area of research in astrophysics. One possible outcome is a pair-instability supernova. In these extremely massive stars, when the core temperature rises high enough, it can produce pairs of electrons and positrons. These particles reduce the pressure support inside the star, causing it to partially collapse, which in turn triggers a runaway thermonuclear explosion that can completely disrupt the star, leaving no remnant behind.

On the other hand, if the star loses enough mass before it explodes (due to the aforementioned stellar winds), it might still undergo a core-collapse supernova and leave behind a black hole. So the fate of these stars depends on a delicate balance between mass loss and the conditions in the core.
