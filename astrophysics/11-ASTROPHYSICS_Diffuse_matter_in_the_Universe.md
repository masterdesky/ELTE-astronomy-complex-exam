# 11. Diffuse matter in the Universe

## 11.1. Interstellar medium
The Interstellar Medium (ISM) is the term given to the matter and radiation that pervades the space between the star systems within a galaxy. This matter is composed of gas in various forms - ionic, atomic, and molecular - as well as dust and cosmic rays. Despite its name, the ISM is far from medium; it is incredibly sparse, with an average density of about one atom per cubic centimeter. However, this density is not uniform and can vary significantly depending on the region, ranging from $10^{4}$ to $10^6$ atoms per cubic centimeter in molecular clouds to less than $10^{-4}$ ions per cubic centimeter in the hot ionized medium. Its material mostly consists of hydrogen and helium, with trace amounts of heavier elements, like carbon, oxygene and nitrogene. About $70\%$ of the mass of the ISM is in the form of hydrogen, 28% is helium, and $1.5\%$ is heavier elements.

As it was mentioned, the ISM is not a uniform entity and can be divided into four distinct phases based on temperature and density: the Cold Neutral Medium (CNM), the Warm Neutral Medium (WNM), the Warm Ionized Medium (WIM), and the Hot Ionized Medium (HIM). Additionally we consider two other important - although extremely rare - phases, the molecular clouds and the H II regions. Each phase has unique properties, each of them are associated with different physical processes and each of them are observed using different techniques.

The ISM is a critical component in the stellar life cycle. It serves as a reservoir for the material that forms stars and planets, and in turn, receives material ejected from stars at the end of their lifecycles. Stars form within the densest regions of the ISM, molecular clouds, and are born with a wide range of masses and properties that depend on the local conditions. Undoubtedly, it is a highly dynamic environment, influenced by stellar radiation and winds, supernova explosions, and the galactic magnetic field. As a result, the combined effects of these phenomena causes the ISM to stray far away from thermal equilibrium.

## 11.2. Interstellar dust and gas
Interstellar dust and gas are the two primary components of the ISM. They are both crucial to the processes that occur within the ISM and have unique properties and roles.

### 11.2.1. Interstellar dust
Interstellar dust is composed of tiny solid particles that range in size from a few nanometers to several micrometers. These particles are complex and heterogeneous, often consisting of a core of silicates or carbonaceous material surrounded by a mantle of ices. Despite making up only about $1\%$ of the mass of the ISM, interstellar dust has a significant impact on the ISM and the galaxy as a whole.

Dust particles can absorb, scatter, and re-emit radiation, influencing the energy balance of the ISM. They also provide surfaces for complex chemical reactions to occur, leading to the formation of molecules, including molecular hydrogen, which is crucial for star formation. Furthermore, dust grains can become polarized, providing valuable information about the magnetic fields in the ISM.

### 11.2.2. Interstellar gas
Interstellar gas makes up the majority of the ISM's mass and is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, with trace amounts of heavier elements. The gas can exist in various forms, including atomic, molecular, and ionized, depending on the local conditions.

The behavior of the interstellar gas is governed by a combination of gravitational forces, pressure forces, magnetic fields, and radiation pressure. These forces can lead to the formation of structures within the ISM, such as molecular clouds, and can trigger the process of star formation.

The interstellar gas is also the site of many interesting physical processes, including shock waves from supernova explosions, ionization and recombination processes, and the propagation of cosmic rays. These processes can influence the properties of the ISM and contribute to the evolution of the galaxy.

## 11.3. Role in star formation and galaxy evolution
The interstellar medium (ISM), with its dust and gas components, plays a pivotal role in both star formation and the broader evolution of galaxies.

### 11.3.1. Star formation
Stars form within the densest regions of the ISM, known as molecular clouds. These clouds are primarily composed of molecular hydrogen ($\mathrm{H}_{2}$), with dust grains embedded within them. The process begins when a portion of a molecular cloud undergoes gravitational collapse. This can be triggered by a variety of mechanisms, such as the shock waves from a nearby supernova explosion or the tidal forces from a close encounter with another galaxy.

As the cloud collapses, it fragments into smaller pieces, each of which can potentially form a star. The dust within the cloud plays a crucial role in this process. It helps to cool the gas by absorbing and re-emitting radiation, allowing the cloud to continue collapsing. Dust grains also provide surfaces for the formation of $\mathrm{H}_{2}$, which is a key coolant in the denser regions of the cloud.

Once a fragment of the cloud has collapsed to a sufficiently high density, a protostar forms at its center. The protostar continues to accrete material from the surrounding cloud until it becomes dense and hot enough to ignite nuclear fusion in its core, at which point it becomes a main sequence star.

### 11.3.2. Galactic evolution
The ISM also plays a key role in the evolution of galaxies. The cycle of star formation and death continually redistributes matter and energy within the galaxy. When stars die, they return material to the ISM via stellar winds or supernova explosions. This material includes heavy elements (also known as metals in astronomical parlance) that were produced by nuclear fusion within the stars. The enrichment of the ISM with metals influences the next generation of stars, as these metals can cool the gas more effectively and enable the formation of planets.

Furthermore, the energy input from stars and supernovae can drive turbulence in the ISM, stir up galactic-scale winds, and even trigger the formation of new stars. This feedback process is crucial for regulating the rate of star formation in a galaxy and for shaping its structure and evolution.

## 11.4. Intergalactic medium
The Intergalactic Medium (IGM) is the gas that fills the vast, seemingly empty spaces between galaxies. It is the largest reservoir of baryonic (ordinary) matter in the universe, and it plays a crucial role in the formation and evolution of galaxies.

The IGM is primarily composed of ionized hydrogen (H II), with trace amounts of helium (both neutral and ionized) and heavier elements. Its density is extremely low, even compared to the ISM, with typical values on the order of one hydrogen atom per cubic meter. Despite this low density, the vast volume of intergalactic space means that the IGM contains a significant amount of matter.

The properties of the IGM are influenced by a variety of processes. These include the gravitational pull of dark matter, which shapes the large-scale structure of the universe, and the radiation from galaxies, which can ionize the gas in the IGM. Supernova explosions and active galactic nuclei can also eject material into the IGM, enriching it with metals.

The IGM is not uniform but is structured on a variety of scales. On the largest scales, it forms a cosmic web, with galaxies located at the intersections of filaments of gas. These filaments are thought to channel gas into galaxies, fueling star formation. In contrast, the regions between the filaments, known as voids, are nearly devoid of both gas and galaxies.

The IGM can be studied through a variety of methods. One of the most powerful is the observation of absorption lines in the spectra of distant quasars, known as the Lyman-alpha forest. These lines are caused by the absorption of the quasar's light by neutral hydrogen in the IGM, and they provide a wealth of information about the temperature, density, and composition of the IGM.
