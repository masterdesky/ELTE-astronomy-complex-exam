# 12. Structure and history of the universe

## 12.1. Cosmological models and current state of cosmology
Cosmology, the study of the universe as a whole, has seen significant advancements in the past century. The current standard model of cosmology is the $\Lambda$CDM (Lambda Cold Dark Matter) model, which is based on the principles of general relativity and assumes a homogeneous and isotropic universe. This model is characterized by a cosmological constant, $\Lambda$, representing dark energy, and cold dark matter.

The $\Lambda$CDM model is supported by a wide range of observations. These include the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, observations of the large-scale structure of the universe, and the Hubble diagram of Type Ia supernovae. The model successfully explains the observed abundance of light elements, the existence of the CMB, the formation of large-scale structures and the accelerated axpansion of the universe.

Mathematical (and geometrical) aspects of the $\Lambda$CDM model builds on the Friedmann-Lema√Ætre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric that is a solution to Einstein's field equations of general relativity and that describes a homogeneous, isotropic, expanding universe. The FLRW metric is characterized by a scale factor, $a(t)$, which describes how the size of the universe changes with time. The behavior of the scale factor is determined by the energy content of the universe, which includes radiation, matter (dark and baryonic), and dark energy.

The current state of cosmology is characterized by precision measurements and the quest to understand the nature of dark matter and dark energy. Despite the success of the $\Lambda$CDM model, there are still several unresolved issues, such as the potential violations of the cosmological principle, the Hubble tension or the $\Omega_{m}-\sigma_{8}$ tension and many more  These issues are the subject of ongoing research in cosmology.

## 12.2. Evolution of the universe
The evolution of the universe is a grand tale of change and growth, from an extremely hot, dense state to the large-scale structures we observe today. Understanding this evolution requires a detailed look at the physical processes that have shaped the universe over time. These processes are governed by the interplay of the content in the universe, and the expansion of space itself.

The universe's evolution is typically divided into distinct eras, each characterized by the dominant physical processes of that time. Additionally, these eras categorized by the balance of matter, radiation, and dark energy, which have each dominated the universe's energy density at different times.

In the earliest moments, the universe was so hot and dense that all four fundamental forces were unified. As the universe expanded and cooled, these forces separated, leading to the formation of particles and the onset of the radiation-dominated era. This was followed by the matter-dominated era, when the energy density of matter overtook that of radiation. Today, we live in a dark energy-dominated era, where the accelerated expansion of the universe is the dominant process.

Each era leaves its imprint on the universe, from the cosmic microwave background radiation to the distribution of galaxies. By studying these imprints, cosmologists can reconstruct the history of the universe and test theories of its evolution.

### 12.2.1. The Start of the universe
The very beginning of the universe is shrouded in mystery, as our current understanding of physics can't describe what happened at the exact moment of the Big Bang. However, we can describe what likely happened shortly after that moment.

The earliest phase of the universe that we can talk about with any form confidence is known as the Planck era, named after Max Planck, the father of quantum theory. This era lasted from the moment of the Big Bang until approximately $10^{-43}$ seconds afterwards. During the Planck era, the size, temperature, and density of the universe were so extreme that the effects of quantum gravity became significant. It is hypo

The Planck era was followed by the grand unification era, which lasted until about $10^{-36}$ seconds after the Big Bang. During this era, gravity decoupled from the strong, weak, and electromagnetic forces that were still unified into a single force at this point. The universe was still extremely hot and dense, and filled with a quark-gluon plasma.

The grand unification era ended with a phase transition that caused the strong force to separate from the electroweak force, an event known as grand unification symmetry breaking. This phase transition is believed to have released a large amount of energy, potentially providing the spark for cosmic inflation.

### 12.2.2. Inflation
Inflation is a hypothetical extremely rapid exponential expansion of the early universe, proposed by Alan Guth in 1980. It's a key component of the current understanding of the early universe, although it's important to note that it's still a theory and the details of the inflationary period are still under active research.

Inflation was proposed to solve several problems with the standard Big Bang theory, including the horizon problem, the flatness problem, and the monopole problem. The horizon problem refers to the question of why distant parts of the universe have the same temperature, despite not being in causal contact. The flatness problem is about the observation that the universe is remarkably close to being spatially flat. The monopole problem refers to the absence of magnetic monopoles in the universe, which are predicted by many grand unified theories.

Inflation posits that the universe underwent a period of rapid expansion, driven by a scalar field known as the inflaton. This rapid expansion would have stretched any inhomogeneities and anisotropies out to scales much larger than the observable universe, leading to a universe that appears flat and homogeneous on large scales. It would also dilute any magnetic monopoles, explaining their absence in the current universe.

The end of inflation is thought to have been followed by a period of reheating, where the inflaton field decayed into particles and radiation, leading to the hot, dense state described by the Big Bang theory.

More information about cosmological inflation can be found in [chapter 7](../cosmology/7-COSMOLOGY_Cosmological_inflation.md) of the cosmology section.

### 12.2.3. Baryogenesis
Baryogenesis refers to the hypothetical physical processes that took place in the early universe to produce baryonic asymmetry, that is, an imbalance in the number of baryons (particles like protons and neutrons) and antibaryons.

In the Standard Model of particle physics, Sakharov conditions are required for baryogenesis to occur. These include baryon number violation, C-symmetry and CP-symmetry violation, and interactions out of thermal equilibrium.

The exact mechanism of baryogenesis remains unknown, but several theories have been proposed. These include electroweak baryogenesis, which suggests that the baryon asymmetry arose during the electroweak phase transition; and leptogenesis, which posits that an initial lepton asymmetry was converted into a baryon asymmetry.

The result of baryogenesis is a universe filled predominantly with matter, a fact that we observe but don't yet fully understand. The mystery of why there is more matter than antimatter is one of the biggest unanswered questions in cosmology.

### 12.2.4. Big Bang Nucleosynthesis
Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) or primordial nucleosynthesis refers to the production of nuclei other than those of the lightest isotope of hydrogen ($\ce{^{1}\mathrm{H}}$, or simply protons) during the early phases of the universe, specifically within the first few minutes after the Big Bang. It is responsible for the formation of stable, light isotopes: $\ce{^{2}\mathrm{H}}$ (deuterium), $\ce{^{3}\mathrm{He}}$, $\ce{^{4}\mathrm{He}}$, and a small amount of $\ce{^{7}\mathrm{Li}}$.

Prior to BBN, the universe was too hot and dense for atomic nuclei to exist. Protons and neutrons continually interacted through weak nuclear forces, maintaining a state of thermal equilibrium. Proton- and neutron decay were happening at an equal rate, thus maintaining a $1:1$ ration of protons and neutrons. As the universe expanded and cooled and the weak nuclear force became less effective, the decay rate of neutrons became slower than that of protons due to the lower mass of protons and their ration shifted in favor of protons. This process is also known as the weak interaction freeze-out.

BBN began about $10$ - $20$ seconds after the Big Bang, when the universe had cooled enough for deuterium to survive. Deuterium acted as a catalyst for the formation of $\ce{^{4}\mathrm{He}}$, and within a few minutes, nearly all of the neutrons had been incorporated into $\ce{^{4}\mathrm{He}}$. The process effectively ended about $20$ minutes after the Big Bang, when the universe had cooled to the point that nuclear fusion could no longer occur. At the start of the BBN, the ratio of protons to neutrons was about $6:1$ and ended up at about $7:1$ after the BBN.

The abundances of light elements predicted by BBN theory match the observed abundances remarkably well. This agreement is one of the major pieces of evidence for the Big Bang model.

### 12.2.5. Matter and radiation dominated eras
The early universe was a hot, dense soup of particles, with energy primarily in the form of radiation. This is known as the radiation-dominated era, which lasted from about one second after the Big Bang until approximately $47\,000$ years later. During this era, the energy density of the universe was dominated by relativistic particles, primarily photons and neutrinos. At this era the energy density and the scale factor of the universe could be characterized by

$$
    \varrho_{R} \propto a^{-4}
    \qquad \text{and} \qquad
    a(t) \propto t^{1/2} \, .
$$

As the universe expanded, it cooled, and the energy density of radiation decreased faster than that of matter. This is because the energy of each individual photon decreases with the expansion of the universe (the wavelength gets stretched), while the number of photons remains constant. On the other hand, the number of matter particles remains constant, and their individual energies do not decrease with expansion. Therefore, the energy density of matter decreases more slowly than that of radiation.

Around $47\,000$ years after the Big Bang, the energy density of matter became greater than that of radiation, marking the beginning of the matter-dominated era. This era lasted until about $9.8$ billion years after the Big Bang. During this time, the universe continued to expand and cool, and structures began to form under the influence of gravity. Similar to the radiation-dominated era, the energy density and the scale factor of the universe could be characterized by

$$
    \varrho_{M} \propto a^{-3}
    \qquad \text{and} \qquad
    a(t) \propto t^{2/3} \, .
$$
### 12.2.6. Recombination and decoupling
In the early matter-dominated era, as the universe continued to expand and cool, two closely related events occurred: the reionization and decoupling of matter.

Decoupling in cosmology refers to the moment when different types of particles stop interacting with each other and start to evolve independently. This is a crucial concept in the evolution of the universe, as it marks the transition from a state where all particles are in thermal equilibrium to a state where different types of particles have different temperatures and densities.

Although it isn't the first instance of decoupling in the history of the universe, the most famous example is the decoupling of photons from baryons, which occurred about $380\,000$ years after the Big Bang. Before this time, the universe was so hot and dense that photons were constantly being absorbed and re-emitted by electrons and protons, keeping them in thermal equilibrium. However, as the universe expanded and cooled, protons and electrons combined to form neutral hydrogen atoms in a process known as recombination. Photons could no longer interact with these neutral atoms as effectively, and they started to travel freely through the universe without being scattered. This is the moment of photon decoupling, and the cosmic microwave background radiation that we observe today is the afterglow of this event.

Neutrinos also underwent a similar process of decoupling earlier in the history of the universe, when the universe was about one second old. Before this time, neutrinos were in thermal equilibrium with electrons, positrons, and photons. However, as the universe cooled, the interaction rate of neutrinos decreased, and they decoupled from the rest of the matter and radiation.

### 12.2.7. Reionization and structure formation
Following the era of recombination and decoupling, the universe entered a period known as the "Dark Ages." During this time, it was filled with neutral hydrogen atoms that absorbed light, rendering the universe opaque to most wavelengths. This epoch came to an end with the advent of reionization and the formation of the first large-scale structures.

**Reionization** refers to the process that ionized the neutral hydrogen atoms, transforming the universe back into a plasma state. This process was driven by the first stars and galaxies, which began to form a few hundred million years after the Big Bang. The ultraviolet light emitted by these early cosmic structures was energetic enough to ionize the surrounding neutral hydrogen, creating expanding bubbles of ionized gas. Over time, these bubbles overlapped and filled the universe, effectively ending the "Dark Ages." By about one billion years after the Big Bang, most of the hydrogen in the universe had been reionized.

Concurrent with reionization was the process of **Structure Formation**, the gravitational assembly of matter into galaxies, clusters of galaxies, and larger structures. Small fluctuations in the density of matter left over from the Big Bang served as the "seeds" for this process. Regions with slightly higher density attracted more matter through gravity, eventually growing into galaxies and larger structures. Dark matter played a crucial role in this process, providing a gravitational "scaffolding" onto which ordinary matter could collapse and form visible structures.

The process of structure formation continues to this day, with galaxies evolving, merging, and assembling into larger structures. Observations of the universe's large-scale structure provide crucial tests of cosmological models and our understanding of gravity and matter.

### 12.2.8. Dark energy dominated era
The current era of the universe, which began about $9.8$ billion years after the Big Bang, is dominated by dark energy. Dark energy is a form of energy that permeates all of space and is believed to be driving the accelerated expansion of the universe.

Its concept was introduced to explain observations of distant SNe that suggested the universe's expansion is accelerating, a discovery that was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2011 to Saul Perlmutter, Brian P. Schmidt, and Adam Riess. The acceleration of the universe's expansion was first observed in 1998, when two independent teams of astronomers used observations of distant SNe to measure the expansion rate of the universe at different times in its history. They found that the expansion rate was slower in the past and has been increasing over time. This acceleration is difficult to explain with matter alone, leading to the hypothesis of dark energy via the reintroduction of Einstein's cosmological constant.

Dark energy is characterized by its equation of state parameter, $w$, the ratio of its pressure to its energy density. The simplest model of dark energy is the cosmological constant, $\Lambda$, which has an equation of state parameter $w = -1$. In this model, the density of dark energy remains constant as the universe expands. This era is characterized by

$$
    \varrho_{\Lambda} \propto a^{0}
    \qquad \text{and} \qquad
    a(t) \propto e^{H_{0} t} \, ,
$$

where $H_{0}$ is the Hubble constant

$$
    H_{0}
    =
    \sqrt{\frac{8 \pi G}{3} \varrho_{0,\text{tot}}} \, ,
$$
is the current expansion rate of the universe. The density parameter $\varrho_{0,\text{tot}}$ is the sum of the density parameters of all the components of the universe, including dark energy, matter, radiation, and curvature. The subscript $0$ indicates that these quantities are evaluated at the present time.

The dark energy dominated era has profound implications for the future of the universe. If the density of dark energy remains constant (as in the cosmological constant model), the universe will continue to expand at an accelerating rate forever, leading to a future in which galaxies outside our local group become unreachable as they recede beyond the cosmic horizon.

## 12.3. The Large-Scale Structure of the universe
The large-scale structure (LSS) of the universe refers to the patterns of galaxies and galaxy clusters on scales of hundreds of millions of light-years. These structures are the result of the gravitational growth of small initial density fluctuations in the early universe, a process that was influenced by dark matter and dark energy.

### 12.3.1. The cosmic web
The LSS contains several unique features that hierarchically assemble into larger structures in a fractal-like manner. On large scales it resembles a "web" that consists of trillions of galaxies and dark matter, with filaments that connect galaxy clusters and form the backbone of this web.

Based on N-body simulations and observations, the largest structures in the universe are filaments and walls that form the boundaries of large voides. Above this scale, no further structures exists and the universe is considered to be homogeneous.

The LSS is characterized by the following structures in hierarchical order:
- **Galaxies**, which are vast collections of stars, gas, dust, and dark matter. Galaxies are the building blocks of the universe's larger structures.
- **Galaxy clusters** are groups of galaxies held together by gravity. They are the largest gravitationally bound structures in the universe and contain hundreds to thousands of galaxies, along with large amounts of hot gas and dark matter.
- **Superclusters** are larger still, consisting of multiple galaxy clusters and groups connected by filaments of galaxies. The Milky Way is part of the Virgo Supercluster.
- **Filaments** are the largest known structures in the universe. They are vast, thread-like formations composed of galaxies and dark matter, forming the boundaries between large voids. The universe on large scales resembles a "cosmic web" of galaxies and dark matter, with filaments that connect galaxy clusters and form the backbone of this web.
- **Walls** or *sheets* are large, flat structures of galaxies that form the outer boundaries of voids and the "walls" of the cosmic web. These structures are a type of filament that are extended in two dimensions.
- **Voids** are regions of the universe with a lower density of galaxies. They are surrounded by filaments and walls and can be tens to hundreds of millions of light-years across. 

The formation and evolution of these structures are governed by the interplay of gravity, dark matter, and dark energy. Gravity pulls matter together, dark matter provides additional gravitational "scaffolding," and dark energy drives the accelerated expansion of the universe, which influences the growth of structure on the largest scales.

### 12.3.2. Observations of the LSS
Observations of the large-scale structure (LSS) of the universe have been made possible through a variety of astronomical surveys. These surveys use different techniques to map the distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters across the sky. Some of the notable surveys include:

- **The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)**: This survey has created the most detailed three-dimensional maps of the Universe ever made, with deep multi-color images of one third of the sky, and spectra for more than three million astronomical objects. SDSS serves as the most important source of data for studying the LSS.
- **The Dark Energy Survey (DES)**: This survey aims to probe the dynamics of the expansion of the universe and the growth of large-scale structures, placing constraints on various models of dark energy. To achieve this goal, the DES collects several types of information, including data from Type Ia supernovae and gravitationally lensed objects, data about the abundancies of galaxy clusters and about the baryon acoustic oscillations.
- **The Planck satellite**: While not a survey of galaxies, the Planck satellite has provided detailed measurements of the cosmic microwave background, which provides information about the very early universe and the initial conditions for the formation of the large-scale structure.

These surveys have revealed the complex, web-like structure of the universe on large scales, with galaxies and galaxy clusters forming filaments and walls around large voids. Observations of the LSS provide crucial data for testing cosmological models and theories of gravity, dark matter, and dark energy.

### 12.3.3. Cosmological simulations
Cosmological simulations are a powerful tool for understanding the formation and evolution of the large-scale structure of the universe. These simulations use mostly the laws of Newtonian gravity to model the behavior of matter in the universe over billions of years. They start with a simple, nearly uniform distribution of matter, as predicted by the Big Bang theory and observations of the cosmic microwave background. Over time, gravity causes matter to clump together, forming galaxies, galaxy clusters, and the large-scale structure.

Simulations are crucial for interpreting observations themeselves. They allow us to predict what the universe should look like given certain assumptions about the nature of the consituents of the universe and even the physical laws governing them in general. By comparing these predictions with observations, we can test different models and potentially discover new physics. However, simulations also have limitations. They require significant computational resources, and they must make approximations to deal with the complexity of the physics involved. Despite these challenges, cosmological simulations have become an indispensable part of modern cosmology.

### 12.3.4. Challenges in studying the LSS
Observations of large-scale structures in the Universe present a complex picture that has implications for our understanding of the standard cosmological model. While this model successfully predicts the existence of a variety of large-scale structures, it also suggests that the Universe should be statistically homogeneous on scales larger than $260 \, \operatorname{Mpc\,h}^{-1}$ as it was shown by (Yadav et al., 2010)[^1]. This prediction is supported by cosmological N-body simulations, which model the gravitational dynamics of large numbers of particles to study the formation and evolution of structure in the Universe.

However, observations have revealed structures on scales that seemingly contradict these predictions. For instance, the Sloan Great Wall and the Great Arc are structures that extend well beyond the scale of homogeneity predicted by N-body simulations. The existence of such vast structures suggests that homogeneity may be violated on extremely large scales. This apparent discrepancy between observations and predictions poses a challenge to our understanding of the Universe's large-scale structure and may point to new physics or a need to revise our models.
