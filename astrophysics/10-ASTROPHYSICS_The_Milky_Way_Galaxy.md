# 10. The Milky Way Galaxy

## 10.1. Structure of the Milky Way
The Milky Way, our home galaxy, is a barred spiral galaxy. This classification is based on its distinct structural features, which include a central bar-shaped structure composed of stars, a flat disk with spiral arms, and a surrounding halo.

As a barred spiral galaxy, the Milky Way consists of several main components: the disk, the bulge (which includes the central bar), and the halo. Each of these components has distinct characteristics and plays a unique role in the overall structure and dynamics of the galaxy.

### 10.1.1. Disk
The disk of the Milky Way is a flattened, circular region that extends out from the galactic center. It is characterized by its thin, flat structure and the ordered, nearly circular orbits of its constituent stars. The disk is a dynamic, active component of the galaxy where various astrophysical processes take place, including star formation.

The Milky Way's disk is composed of two main parts: a so-called "thin disk" and the "thick disk". The thin disk contains the spiral arms and is the site of ongoing star formation. It is populated by relatively young stars, typically less than a few billion years old, and a significant amount of interstellar medium (ISM), composed of atomic and molecular gas and dust. This ISM is the raw material for star formation.

The thick disk, on the other hand, is populated by older stars and has a much lower density of interstellar gas and dust, also a significantly lower level of metallicity. The stars in the thick disk have higher velocities compared to those in the thin disk, leading to a "thicker" distribution of stars.

The Milky Way's disk also contains a variety of structures, including the spiral arms, which are regions of higher density where star formation is currently taking place or has recently occurred. The Milky Way is classified as a barred spiral galaxy, indicating the presence of a central bar structure composed of stars, which is thought to influence the dynamics of the galaxy and the formation of the spiral arms.

The disk also plays a crucial role in the evolution of the Milky Way. The processes of star formation and stellar evolution within the disk contribute to the chemical enrichment of the ISM, as stars produce heavier elements through nuclear fusion and then return this material to the ISM through stellar winds and supernova explosions.

### 10.1.2. Bulge
The bulge of the Milky Way is a densely packed, spheroidal region located at the heart of the galaxy. This central structure is distinct from the disk, both in terms of its stellar population and kinematics.

The Milky Way's bulge exhibits a boxy or bar-like shape, a characteristic that has been revealed through detailed observations of star counts and the distribution of stellar velocities. This boxy shape is thought to be the result of a bar instability in the disk of the galaxy.

The stars in the Milky Way's bulge are predominantly old, with a significant fraction being more than $10$ billion years old. These stars are generally metal-rich, suggesting that they formed from a gas that had already been enriched by previous generations of stars. However, the bulge also contains a smaller population of younger, metal-poor stars, indicating a complex star formation history.

The bulge of the Milky Way is also notable for its role in hosting the galaxy's central supermassive black hole, known as Sagittarius A*. The presence of this black hole has been inferred from the rapid motion of stars near the galactic center, and it plays a crucial role in the dynamics and evolution of the bulge.

### 10.1.3. Halo
The halo of the Milky Way is a vast, spherical region that surrounds the disk and bulge. It extends much further out than the visible components of the galaxy and is thought to contain a significant fraction of the Milky Way's mass.

It is composed of two main components: the stellar halo and the dark matter halo. The stellar halo consists of a sparse population of old, metal-poor stars, including both individual stars and globular clusters. These stars are thought to be some of the oldest in the Milky Way, providing valuable insights into the early stages of the galaxy's formation.

The dark matter halo, on the other hand, is an invisible component that does not emit or absorb light but can be detected through its gravitational effects. The presence of dark matter is inferred from the motions of stars and gas within the galaxy, as well as from the deflection of light from more distant galaxies (gravitational lensing). The dark matter halo is believed to play a crucial role in the formation and evolution of the Milky Way, providing the gravitational "scaffolding" on which the galaxy formed.

The halo also contains hot, diffuse gas that emits X-rays. This gas is thought to be continually replenished by supernova explosions within the disk of the galaxy.

Understanding the properties of the Milky Way's halo, including its size, mass, and composition, is a key challenge in astronomy and is crucial for our understanding of the formation and evolution of the Milky Way. It can also provide valuable insights into the nature of dark matter, which has one of the most strongest influential effect on these processes.

### 10.1.4. Galactic center
The galactic center of the Milky Way is a dynamic and complex region that hosts a variety of astrophysical phenomena. It is located at the heart of the galaxy, within the central bulge, and is characterized by its high density of stars and interstellar medium.

One of the most notable features of the Milky Way's galactic center is the presence of a supermassive black hole, known as Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*). This black hole has a mass of about four million times that of the Sun and plays a crucial role in the dynamics of the central region of the galaxy. The presence of Sgr A* has been inferred from the rapid motion of stars near the galactic center, as well as from observations of electromagnetic radiation, including radio waves and X-rays, that is emitted by hot gas and dust near the black hole.

Surrounding Sgr A* is a region known as the central parsec, which contains a dense cluster of stars, known as the Nuclear Star Cluster. These stars are subject to intense gravitational forces due to the proximity of the supermassive black hole and exhibit complex dynamics as a result. A peculiar feature of the NSC in our galaxy is that its mass is comparable to that of the supermassive black hole, whereas in most other galaxies the black hole is much more massive than the NSC.

The galactic center is also a site of intense star formation, as the high density of the interstellar medium provides ample material for the formation of new stars. However, the star formation process in this region is not well understood, as the strong tidal forces from the supermassive black hole could inhibit the collapse of gas clouds that is necessary for star formation.

## 10.2. Spiral arms and star formation regions
The Milky Way, as a barred spiral galaxy, features prominent spiral arms that extend from the central bar. These arms are regions of higher density in the galactic disk and are characterized by their ongoing star formation activity.

Spiral arms are thought to be the result of density waves that propagate through the disk of the galaxy. These waves compress the interstellar medium as they pass, triggering the collapse of gas clouds and the subsequent formation of new stars. This star formation activity gives the spiral arms their bright, blue appearance, as young, hot stars are luminous and emit light primarily in the blue part of the spectrum.

In addition to young stars, the spiral arms also contain a variety of other structures associated with star formation, including stellar clusters and HII regions. These will be discussed in more detail in the following sections.

### 10.2.1. Stellar clusters
Stellar clusters are groups of stars that are gravitationally bound and that formed from the same giant molecular cloud. They are commonly found in the spiral arms of the Milky Way, where star formation activity is high. Stellar clusters are crucial for our understanding of stellar evolution, as the stars within a cluster are at the same distance from us, have the same age, and were formed from the same material.

There are two main types of stellar clusters: open clusters and globular clusters.

- **Open clusters**, also known as galactic clusters, are relatively young and contain hundreds to thousands of stars. They are located in the galactic disk, particularly in the spiral arms. The stars in open clusters are usually formed together, and the cluster can remain gravitationally bound for several hundred million years. Over time, gravitational interactions with other stars and gas clouds cause the cluster to disperse. Examples of open clusters in the Milky Way include the Pleiades and the Hyades.
- **Globular clusters**, on the other hand, are much older, contain tens of thousands to millions of stars, and are found in the halo of the galaxy. These clusters are densely packed, with stars much closer together than in open clusters. Globular clusters are among the oldest objects in the Milky Way, with ages of around 10 to 13 billion years. Their stars were formed early in the galaxy's history, and the clusters have remained gravitationally bound ever since. Examples of globular clusters in the Milky Way include Omega Centauri and 47 Tucanae.

### 10.2.2. HII regions
HII regions are areas of interstellar medium that are ionized by the ultraviolet light from hot, young stars. These regions are often associated with star-forming clouds in the spiral arms of the Milky Way and are characterized by their emission of light at specific wavelengths, particularly in the red part of the spectrum due to the recombination of electrons with protons to form hydrogen atoms.

HII regions are named for the large amount of ionized hydrogen they contain, denoted as HII (H I refers to neutral atomic hydrogen and H2 to molecular hydrogen). These regions are typically dense and relatively short-lived, lasting only a few million years before the ionizing stars exhaust their fuel and the ionized gas disperses.

The size and shape of an HII region are determined by the balance between the rate of ionization by the hot stars and the rate of recombination of electrons and protons. HII regions can range in size from tiny, compact regions associated with a single star to giant HII regions that contain hundreds of ionizing stars and extend over hundreds of light-years.

HII regions are important sites of ongoing star formation. The dense gas clouds associated with HII regions can collapse under their own gravity to form new stars. The process of star formation in turn influences the structure and evolution of the HII region, as the energy output from the newly formed stars can trigger further star formation or disperse the surrounding gas.

Notable examples of HII regions in the Milky Way include the Orion Nebula and the Eagle Nebula. These regions are often visible in images of the galaxy due to their bright emission of light.

## 10.3. Galactic dynamics
### 10.3.1. Rotation curve
The rotation curve of a galaxy is a plot of the orbital speeds of visible stars or gas in the galaxy versus their radial distance from the galaxy's center. It is a crucial tool for studying the mass distribution within the galaxy.

In the case of the Milky Way, observations of the rotation curve have revealed some intriguing results. If the mass of the Milky Way were concentrated towards the center, we would expect the orbital speed to decrease as we move away from the center, similar to the way planets in our solar system orbit the Sun. However, the rotation curve of the Milky Way remains relatively flat out to a large radius. This implies that the mass of the Milky Way is more spread out and extends well beyond the visible disk of the galaxy.

This discrepancy between the observed rotation curve and the expected Keplerian decline led to the postulation of dark matter. Dark matter is a form of matter that does not emit or absorb light but interacts through gravity. The presence of a large amount of dark matter in the halo of the Milky Way would explain the flat rotation curve.

The rotation curve of the Milky Way has been determined using a variety of observational techniques, including measurements of the Doppler shift of spectral lines from gas clouds in the disk of the galaxy and observations of the proper motions of stars. Its study is crucial to our understanding of the dynamics of the galaxy, the distribution of its mass, and thus the nature of dark matter.

### 10.3.2. Dark matter
Dark matter is a form of matter that does not emit or absorb light, making it invisible to current detection methods. However, its existence is inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter, such as stars and galaxies. Dark matter is a crucial component of the universe, making up about 85% of the total matter.

In every galaxies in the universe, including the Milky Way, dark matter is thought to reside in a vast, roughly spherical halo that extends well beyond the visible components of the galaxy. The presence of dark matter in the Milky Way is inferred from the galaxy's rotation curve, which remains flat out to a large radius, indicating that the mass of the Milky Way extends well beyond its visible disk.

It is measured that around 85% of the Milky Way's mass is dark matter, with the remaining 15% being visible matter. Its gravitational influence helps to stabilize the disk of the galaxy, maintain the structure of the spiral arms, and influence the motion of stars and gas within the galaxy.

Despite its importance, the nature of dark matter remains one of the biggest mysteries in modern physics. Various candidates have been proposed, including weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), axions, and sterile neutrinos, but none have been definitively detected.

## 10.4. The Milky Way's neighborhood
The Milky Way is not an isolated galaxy but is part of a gravitationally bound collection of galaxies known as the Local Group. The Local Group spans about $10$ million light-years in diameter and contains more than $80$ galaxies, although most of these are small dwarf galaxies.

The two most massive galaxies in the Local Group are the Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy (M31), which are spiral galaxies. These two galaxies, along with the Triangulum Galaxy (M33), are the only large spiral galaxies in the Local Group.

The Milky Way has several satellite galaxies, which are smaller galaxies that orbit the Milky Way. The most well-known of these are the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, which are visible from the Southern Hemisphere. Other notable satellite galaxies include the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy and the Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy.

The Local Group is part of a larger cosmic structure known as the Virgo Supercluster, which contains many other groups and clusters of galaxies. The Virgo Supercluster, in turn, is part of an even larger structure known as the Laniakea Supercluster.
