## 4.1. Molecular clouds and their properties
Molecular clouds, sometimes expressively called as "stellar nurseries", serve as the primary sites of star formation within our Milky Way and other galaxies. These substantial structures within the interstellar medium are characterized by their large size and considerable mass, with diameters spanning tens to hundreds of light years and mass ranging from a few hundred to several million times that of the Sun.

Compositionally, molecular clouds are predominantly comprised of molecular hydrogen $(\operatorname{H}^{2})$. However, these clouds also harbor smaller quantities of other molecules, such as carbon monoxide $(\operatorname{CO})$, along with dust particles. These molecules, particularly $\operatorname{CO}$, are of significant interest to astronomers. Despite their relative scarcity within the cloud, these molecules emit radiation that we can detect and study, providing valuable insights into the properties of these clouds.

In terms of their physical conditions, molecular clouds are remarkably cold, with temperatures usually plunging below $70 K$. Additionally, these clouds exhibit higher densities compared to other regions of the interstellar medium, with typical values ranging from $100$ to $1000$ molecules per cubic centimeter.

Their dynamics are characterized by turbulence and the potential to collapse under the influence of their own gravity. This propensity for gravitational collapse is a key factor in their role as stellar nurseries. Typically, the lifetimes of these clouds span a few million years. During this time, the processes associated with star formation can cause significant disruption, leading either to the destruction of the cloud or paving the way for the creation of new clouds.

The cold temperatures and high densities within molecular clouds promote the formation of molecules, a factor that is critical for the cloud's ability to cool and collapse, thus initiating star formation. Furthermore, the substantial size and mass of these clouds mean that they can trigger the formation of many stars simultaneously, often leading to the birth of clusters of stars. Therefore, the properties of molecular clouds are intrinsically tied to their role in star formation, and understanding these characteristics is fundamental to our comprehension of the star birth process.

## 4.2. Gravitational collapse and fragmentation
Gravitational collapse is the fundamental process that leads to star formation within molecular clouds. When a portion of a molecular cloud gathers enough mass and density, either through self-gravitation or due to local perturbances caused by outside forces, its own gravity can cause it to collapse inward, initiating the birth of a new star. This process can be split into several distinct phases, but here I'll focus only on the initial stages of collapse and fragmentation, followed by the formation of a protostar.

### 4.2.1. Jeans instability
One of the critical concepts linked to gravitational collapse is the Jeans instability, named after the British physicist James Jeans. The Jeans criterion establishes a threshold for collapse: a cloud - or a part thereof - will collapse if if its radius surpasses the *Jeans length*

$$
\lambda_{J}
=
\left(
    \frac{15 k_{B} T}{4 \pi G m_{p} \mu \varrho}
\right)^{\frac{1}{2}} \, ,
$$

where $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the temperature of the cloud, $G$ is the gravitational constant, $m_{p}$ is the mass of a proton, $\mu$ is the mean molecular weight of the cloud, and $\varrho$ is the density of the cloud. Similarly, a cloud will collapse if its mass exceeds the *Jeans mass*

$$
M_{J}
=
\frac{4 \pi}{3} \varrho \left( \frac{\lambda_{J}}{2} \right)^{3} \, .
$$

Both the Jeans mass and length are dependent on the temperature and density of the cloud, along with the mass of the particles it contains. A cloud that is cooler and denser will possess a smaller Jeans mass and length, which elevates the likelihood of gravitational collapse.

### 4.2.2. Fragmentation
As a cloud undergoes gravitational collapse, it doesn't typically form a single star. Instead, the cloud often fragments into multiple smaller clumps, each capable of forming a star or even multiple stars. This fragmentation process is attributed to several factors, including thermal instabilities and rotational dynamics within the collapsing cloud. The outcome is frequently a cluster of stars, all of which originate from the same parent cloud. Additionally, fragmentation results in a broad spectrum of stellar masses, a crucial factor in determining the varieties of stars that form and their subsequent evolution.

## 4.3. Protostars and accretion disks
During the early stages of star formation, as a fragment of a molecular cloud continues to contract under its own gravity, the gravitational potential energy of the gas is transformed into thermal energy. This conversion results in the heating of the central region of the cloud fragment, leading to the formation of a protostar—a hot, dense core of gas that is in the process of becoming a star.

As the protostar evolves, it gradually accrues material from the surrounding cloud, a process known as accretion. The gas from the cloud doesn't fall directly onto the protostar, but instead spirals inwards, forming a rotating accretion disk around the protostar. This disk not only fuels the growth of the protostar but also plays a crucial role in the formation of planetary systems.


### 4.3.1. Protostar Evolution and Accretion
The evolution of a protostar itself can also be characterized by a series of stages. Initially, the protostar is deeply embedded within the cloud fragment and is thus heavily obscured from optical telescopes. During this phase, the thermally evolving protostar primarily emits radiation in the infrared via blackbody radiation and dust re-radiation. As the protostar continues to accumulate mass, it also grows in size and temperature.

The accretion process is not constant but can vary over time. It's often associated with energetic phenomena such as outflows and jets, which are thought to be driven by the interaction of the accreting material with the magnetic fields of the protostar and the accretion disk.

The protostar phase concludes when the core of the protostar becomes sufficiently hot and dense for nuclear fusion to begin. This marks the birth of a new star. The onset of nuclear fusion initiates the transition from the protostar stage to the main sequence stage of a star’s life, wherein the star shines by fusing hydrogen into helium in its core.
