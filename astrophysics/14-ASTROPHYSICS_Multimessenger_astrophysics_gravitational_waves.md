# 14. Multimessenger astrophysics
Multimessenger astrophysics is a rapidly evolving field that uses information from a tandem of different types of astronomical messengers to understand the universe. These messengers include electromagnetic radiation (light), gravitational waves, neutrinos, and cosmic rays. Each of these messengers provides a unique perspective on the universe and its phenomena, and by combining these perspectives, we can gain a more complete understanding of astronomical events.

The fundamental principle behind multimessenger astrophysics is that different types of messengers are produced by different physical processes. For example, light is produced by the electromagnetic interactions of charged particles, while gravitational waves are produced by the acceleration of massive objects. Neutrinos are produced by weak nuclear interactions, and cosmic rays are high-energy particles that are accelerated by various processes in the universe.

The key advantage of multimessenger astrophysics is that it allows us to probe astronomical phenomena that are otherwise inaccessible. For example, electromagnetic radiation is often absorbed or scattered by interstellar and intergalactic media, making it difficult to observe distant or obscured sources. However, gravitational waves, neutrinos, and cosmic rays can travel unimpeded through these media, providing us with information that would otherwise be lost.

## 14.1. Multimessenger events
Multimessenger events are astronomical events that produce multiple types of messengers. These events are particularly interesting because they allow us to study the same phenomenon through different physical processes, providing a more complete picture of the event. The most notable examples of multimessenger events are neutron star mergers and gamma-ray bursts.

### 14.1.1. Neutron star mergers
Neutron star mergers occur when two neutron stars in a binary system spiral inwards and eventually collide. These events are incredibly energetic and produce a variety of messengers. Electromagnetic radiation is produced across the entire spectrum, from radio waves to gamma rays. Gravitational waves are produced by the spiraling and merging of the neutron stars, and a burst of neutrinos is produced during the merger. Additionally, the collision of the neutron stars can produce a short gamma-ray burst and a kilonova, an optical and infrared counterpart to the merger.

The first observation of a neutron star merger through both gravitational waves and electromagnetic radiation was made in 2017 (GW170817), marking a significant milestone in multimessenger astrophysics. The event allowed for the confirmation of several theoretical predictions, such as the association of short gamma-ray bursts with neutron star mergers and the production of heavy elements through r-process nucleosynthesis in kilonovae.

### 14.1.2. Gamma ray bursts
Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most energetic events in the universe, producing a brief flash of gamma rays that can be detected across cosmological distances. GRBs are classified into two types, long and short, based on their duration. Long GRBs are believed to be associated with the collapse of massive stars, while short GRBs are believed to be associated with the merger of compact objects, such as neutron stars.

GRBs are multimessenger events because they produce both electromagnetic radiation and high-energy particles. The gamma-ray flash is followed by an afterglow in X-rays, optical light, and radio waves, which is produced by the interaction of the GRB jet with the surrounding medium. High-energy particles, such as neutrinos and cosmic rays, can also be produced in the GRB jet.

The detection of neutrinos or gravitational waves from a GRB would provide valuable information about the physics of these events. However, despite extensive searches, no neutrinos or gravitational waves have been detected from a GRB as of the time of writing.

However, research suggests that the detection of high-energy neutrinos from GRBs is possible with current and future neutrino detectors. For example, a study by (Kimura et al., 2017)[^1] estimates the neutrino signals from different emission stages of short GRBs and finds that neutrino signals associated with the extended emission are the most promising for detection.

Another study by (Bartos et al., 2013)[^2] also predicts possible GRB detections by the DeepCore array of the IceCube neutrino observatory, suggesting that the detection of $10-100 \operatorname{GeV}$ neutrinos would shed light on the composition of GRB jets and their Lorentz factors.

The detection of neutrinos from GRBs would provide valuable information about the physics of these events, including the mechanisms of particle acceleration and the properties of the GRB jets. It would also confirm the association of GRBs with high-energy cosmic rays, as the same processes that produce high-energy neutrinos are expected to produce high-energy cosmic rays.

## 14.2. Neutrino astronomy
Neutrino astronomy is the study of astronomical objects and phenomena through the detection of neutrinos. Neutrinos are elementary particles that interact only weakly with matter, making them ideal messengers for probing regions of the universe that are inaccessible to electromagnetic radiation.

Neutrinos are produced in a variety of astrophysical processes, including nuclear reactions in stars, supernova explosions, and the interactions of cosmic rays with interstellar and intergalactic media. By studying these neutrinos, we can gain insights into the processes that produce them and the environments in which they are produced.

Neutrino detectors on Earth, such as the Super-Kamiokande detector in Japan, detect neutrinos by observing the light produced when a neutrino interacts with a particle of matter. This interaction creates a charged particle that moves faster than the speed of light in the medium, resulting in a shock wave of light known as Cherenkov radiation.

### 14.2.1. Solar neutrinos
Solar neutrinos are neutrinos produced by nuclear reactions in the Sun. These reactions occur in the core of the Sun, where the temperature and pressure are high enough to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between protons, allowing them to fuse and create helium. This process, known as nuclear fusion, powers the Sun and produces neutrinos as a byproduct.

The detection of solar neutrinos provides a direct probe of the nuclear reactions occurring in the core of the Sun. This has led to important discoveries in both astrophysics and particle physics, including the confirmation of the theory of stellar nucleosynthesis and the discovery of neutrino oscillation, a phenomenon in which neutrinos change from one type (or "flavor") to another as they travel.

The first detection of solar neutrinos was made by the Homestake experiment in the 1960s, which observed fewer neutrinos than predicted by the standard solar model. This discrepancy, known as the solar neutrino problem, was resolved by the discovery of neutrino oscillation, which implies that some of the electron neutrinos produced in the Sun had changed into muon or tau neutrinos, which the Homestake experiment was not sensitive to.

### 14.2.2. Supernova neutrinos
Supernova neutrinos are neutrinos produced by the core-collapse of massive stars. When a star with a mass greater than about $8 \operatorname{M_{\odot}}$ exhausts its nuclear fuel, it can no longer support itself against its own gravity and collapses, forming a neutron star or black hole and triggering a supernova explosion.

The collapse of the core and the subsequent supernova explosion produce a burst of neutrinos, which carry away most of the gravitational energy released in the collapse. These neutrinos are emitted before the supernova explosion becomes visible in light, making them the first messengers of a supernova event.

The detection of supernova neutrinos provides valuable information about the physics of core-collapse supernovae and the properties of neutrinos. The first and so far only detection of supernova neutrinos was made in 1987, when neutrino detectors in Japan and the United States observed a burst of neutrinos from Supernova 1987A, a supernova explosion in the Large Magellanic Cloud.

The detection of Supernova 1987A confirmed the basic picture of core-collapse supernovae and provided the first direct evidence for the existence of neutrino oscillation. Future detections of supernova neutrinos could provide further insights into these phenomena and potentially reveal new physics.

## 14.3. Cosmic rays
Cosmic rays are high-energy particles from space, primarily protons and atomic nuclei, that bombard the Earth from all directions. They were discovered in the early 20th century and have been studied extensively to understand their origins, acceleration mechanisms, and propagation through the universe.

Cosmic rays are important messengers in multimessenger astrophysics because they provide information about the most energetic processes in the universe. However, unlike other messengers, cosmic rays are charged particles and are therefore deflected by magnetic fields in space. This makes it difficult to trace them back to their sources, but by studying their energy spectrum, composition, and arrival directions, we can gain insights into the cosmic ray sources and the environments in which they are accelerated.

### 14.3.1. Cosmic ray sources
The sources of cosmic rays are still a subject of ongoing research, but it is generally believed that the majority of cosmic rays with energies up to about $10^{15} \operatorname{eV}$ are produced in our own galaxy, while cosmic rays with higher energies, known as ultra-high-energy cosmic rays, are of extragalactic origin.

Potential sources of galactic cosmic rays include supernova remnants, pulsars, and stellar winds, where shock waves can accelerate particles to high energies. These sources are capable of accelerating protons and atomic nuclei to energies of up to about $10^{15} \operatorname{eV}$, known as the "knee" of the cosmic ray spectrum.

Potential sources of extragalactic cosmic rays include active galactic nuclei, gamma-ray bursts, and galaxy clusters. These sources are capable of accelerating particles to energies above the "ankle" of the cosmic ray spectrum, around $10^{18} \operatorname{eV}$, up to the maximum observed energy of about $10^{20} \operatorname{eV}$, known as the Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin limit.

### 14.3.2. Cosmic ray spectrum
The cosmic ray spectrum is a plot of the number of cosmic rays as a function of their energy. It follows a power law, with the number of cosmic rays decreasing steeply as their energy increases. However, there are two features in the spectrum, known as the "knee" and the "ankle", where the power law index changes.

The "knee" of the spectrum, at an energy of about 10^15 eV, is believed to mark the maximum energy to which cosmic rays can be accelerated in our galaxy. Above this energy, the cosmic ray flux decreases more rapidly, suggesting a change in the acceleration mechanism or the escape of cosmic rays from the galaxy.

The "ankle" of the spectrum, at an energy of about 10^18 eV, is believed to mark the transition from galactic to extragalactic cosmic rays. Above this energy, the cosmic ray flux decreases less rapidly, suggesting a new population of cosmic rays from extragalactic sources.

### 14.3.3. Impact of cosmic rays on the Earth
Cosmic rays impact the Earth's atmosphere, producing showers of secondary particles that can be detected on the ground. These cosmic ray air showers are used to measure the energy and direction of the primary cosmic ray.

Cosmic rays also have various effects on the Earth and its atmosphere. They ionize the atmosphere, affecting atmospheric chemistry and possibly influencing the Earth's climate. They also produce isotopes in the atmosphere and in terrestrial materials, which can be used for dating purposes. They especially pose a radiation hazard to astronauts and space electronics. This effect has serious implications for space travel and the design of space missions.

## 14.4. Gravitational waves
Gravitational waves are ripples in the fabric of spacetime caused by the acceleration of massive objects. They were first predicted by Albert Einstein in 1916 as a consequence of his general theory of relativity, which describes gravity as the curvature of spacetime by mass and energy.

Gravitational waves propagate at the speed of light (or more like *"light propagates at the speed of gravitational waves"*-dgy) and can pass through matter without being scattered or absorbed, making them ideal messengers for studying the universe. They carry information about their sources, such as their masses, spins, and orbital parameters, as well as about the nature of gravity itself.

The importance of gravitational waves in astrophysics and multimessenger astronomy lies in their unique properties. Unlike electromagnetic radiation, which is produced by the electromagnetic interactions of charged particles, gravitational waves are produced by the motion of mass and energy. This means that they can be produced by sources that do not emit light, such as black holes, or that are obscured by dust and gas, such as the cores of supernovae.

Moreover, gravitational waves provide a new way to probe the universe at the highest energies. The most energetic events in the universe, such as the mergers of black holes and neutron stars, produce strong gravitational waves that can be detected across cosmological distances. By studying these waves, we can gain insights into the physics of these extreme events and test the predictions of general relativity in the strong-field regime.

### 14.4.1. Sources of gravitational waves
Gravitational waves are produced by the acceleration of mass. Therefore, any system with changing quadrupole moment (a measure of the distribution of mass in a system) can potentially emit gravitational waves. However, due to the weak nature of gravity, significant gravitational waves that can be detected are produced by astrophysical events involving massive objects and high velocities. Some of the key sources include:

- **Binary systems**, such as binary neutron stars or black holes, are one of the most important sources of gravitational waves. As the two objects orbit each other, they emit gravitational waves, which carry away energy from the system. This causes the orbit to shrink, and the objects spiral inwards, leading to faster and stronger gravitational waves. The gravitational wave signal from these systems increases in frequency and amplitude over time, in a characteristic pattern known as a chirp.
- **Supernovae**, more specifically core-collapse supernovae, the explosive deaths of massive stars, can also produce gravitational waves. The collapse of the core to a neutron star or black hole is expected to be asymmetric due to complex hydrodynamic processes, leading to the emission of gravitational waves. However, the signal is expected to be much weaker than that from binary mergers, and has not yet been detected as of the time of writing.
- **Cosmic strings**, hypothetical one-dimensional defects in spacetime predicted by some theories of the early universe, can also produce gravitational waves if they exist. The formation, evolution, and interaction of cosmic strings would produce a stochastic background of gravitational waves, which could be detected with future gravitational wave observatories.
- A **stochastic background** of gravitational waves is expected from the superposition of many unresolved sources, such as binary systems throughout the universe. This background could be detected by correlating the signals from multiple detectors.
- **Inflation**, a period of rapid expansion in the early universe, is expected to produce a stochastic background of gravitational waves. These primordial gravitational waves would leave a characteristic imprint on the cosmic microwave background and the distribution of galaxies, which could be detected with future observations.

### 14.4.2. Physical description of gravitational waves
Gravitational waves are described by the theory of general relativity. They are perturbations in the metric of spacetime, which describes the geometry of spacetime and how objects move within it.

The usual introductionary approach to the description of gravitational waves is to describe them in the weak-field limit, where the gravitational field is weak and the velocities are small compared to the speed of light. In this case the metric tensor is assumed to be close to the flat spacetime metric, and the metric can be written as the flat spacetime metric plus a small perturbation:

$$
    g_{\alpha\beta} = \eta_{\alpha\beta} + h_{\alpha\beta}
$$
The perturbation is represented by a symmetric 4x4 matrix $h_{\alpha\beta}$, which describes the gravitational wave, while the flat spacetime metric is represented by the Minkowski metric $\eta_{\alpha\beta}$. The wave equation that describes gravitational waves in this limit, can be written as:

$$
    \Box h_{\alpha\beta} = -16 \pi T_{\alpha\beta}
$$

where $\Box$ is the d'Alembertian operator, $h_{\alpha\beta}$ is the perturbation, and $T_{\alpha\beta}$ is the stress-energy tensor, which describes the distribution of mass and energy.

This equation states that the curvature of spacetime, represented by the d'Alembertian of the perturbation, is proportional to the mass-energy content, represented by the stress-energy tensor. It is a wave equation, and its solutions represent gravitational waves. Gravitational waves are transverse waves, which means they oscillate perpendicular to the direction of propagation. They have two polarization states, often called "plus" (denoted with $+$) and "cross" (denoted with $\times$), which describe the shape of the oscillation.

A passing gravitational wave will cause a "stretching" and "squeezing" effect in these two perpendicular directions. If we imagine a ring of particles in the plane perpendicular to the direction of propagation, a $+$-polarized wave will cause the ring to deform into an ellipse, first stretching in one direction and squeezing in the perpendicular direction, then vice versa. A $\times$-polarized wave will cause a similar deformation, but rotated by $45$ degrees.

### 14.4.3. Gravitational wave detection
The detection of gravitational waves is a remarkable technological achievement. Gravitational waves are incredibly weak, causing distortions in spacetime on the order of a thousandth of the diameter of a proton. To detect these tiny signals, scientists have built some of the most sensitive instruments in the world.

The most successful type of gravitational wave detector so far is the laser interferometer. The basic idea of a laser interferometer is to split a laser beam into two beams, send them down two perpendicular arms, reflect them back with mirrors, and then recombine them. If a gravitational wave passes through the interferometer, it will stretch one arm and squeeze the other, causing a change in the interference pattern of the recombined beams.

The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) in the United States and the Virgo detector in Italy are examples of laser interferometers. They have arms several kilometers long and use sophisticated techniques to isolate the detectors from non-gravitational wave disturbances and to measure the tiny changes in arm length caused by passing gravitational waves.

The detection of gravitational waves requires the careful analysis of the detector data to extract the gravitational wave signals and infer the properties of their sources. This involves matched filtering, a technique that cross-correlates the detector data with theoretical templates of gravitational wave signals, and parameter estimation, a technique that uses Bayesian inference to determine the source properties and their uncertainties.

The future of gravitational wave detection includes the development of new detectors, such as the KAGRA detector in Japan and the proposed LIGO-India detector, and the improvement of existing detectors to increase their sensitivity. There are also plans for a space-based detector, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), which could detect lower-frequency gravitational waves from sources such as supermassive black hole mergers and binary white dwarf systems.

### 14.4.5. Impact of gravitational wave observations
The detection of gravitational waves has opened a new window on the universe, providing a new way to observe and study astronomical phenomena. This has had a profound impact on our understanding of the universe and has led to several groundbreaking discoveries.

- **Binary black hole mergers**: The first detection of gravitational waves by LIGO in 2015 was from the merger of two black holes, an event that cannot be observed with electromagnetic radiation. This confirmed the existence of binary black hole systems and provided a direct test of general relativity in the strong-field regime.
- **Neutron star mergers**: The first observation of a binary neutron star merger through both gravitational waves and electromagnetic radiation was made in 2017. This marked the birth of multimessenger astronomy with gravitational waves and light, and led to several important discoveries, such as the confirmation of the association of short gamma-ray bursts with neutron star mergers and the direct observation of the production of heavy elements through *r*-process nucleosynthesis.
- **Tests of General Relativity**: Gravitational wave observations provide stringent tests of general relativity. So far, these observations have been consistent with the predictions of general relativity, placing tight constraints on alternative theories of gravity.
- **Cosmology**: Gravitational waves can be used to measure the expansion rate of the universe, known as the Hubble constant. The observation of a binary neutron star merger with both gravitational waves and light provided an independent measurement of the Hubble constant, contributing to the resolution of the current tension between different measurements.
- **Future prospects**: The future of gravitational wave astronomy is bright, with several new detectors planned or under construction. These will increase the volume of the universe that can be observed with gravitational waves, leading to more detections and new discoveries. Future observations of binary neutron star mergers could provide insights into the equation of state of neutron star matter, and observations of supernovae could reveal the dynamics of the core-collapse process. The detection of a stochastic background of gravitational waves could provide insights into the early universe and the nature of gravity.

Gravitational waves are a powerful tool in multimessenger astronomy, providing unique insights into the universe and its phenomena. Their detection has opened a new era in astronomy, and future observations promise to reveal even more details about our universe.
