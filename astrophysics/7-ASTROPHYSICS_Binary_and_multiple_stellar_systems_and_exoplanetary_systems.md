# 7. Binary and multiple stellar systems and exoplanetary systems
Binary and multiple stellar systems are systems in which two or more stars are gravitationally bound and orbit a common center of mass. These systems are prevalent in the universe, with estimates suggesting that more than half of all stars are part of multiple star systems. The study of these systems provides critical insights into stellar formation, evolution, and end states.

Exoplanetary systems, on the other hand, are planetary systems that orbit stars outside of our own Solar System. The study of these systems has revolutionized our understanding of the universe, revealing a vast diversity of planets and planetary systems. The discovery of exoplanets has also fueled the search for extraterrestrial life, as some of these planets lie within their star's habitable zone, where conditions might be right for life as we know it.

The study of binary and multiple stellar systems and exoplanetary systems is a complex and multifaceted field, encompassing topics such as formation and evolution, mass transfer and accretion, detection methods, and the impact of host star properties on exoplanetary systems.

## 7.1. Formation and evolution of binary and multiple systems
Binary and multiple star systems are a common occurrence in the cosmos, with a significant proportion of stars being part of such systems. These systems are formed from the same molecular cloud and remain gravitationally bound throughout their lifetimes. The formation and evolution of these systems are complex processes, influenced by a variety of factors, including the initial conditions of the molecular cloud and the subsequent dynamical interactions between the stars.

### 7.1.1 Formation
The formation of binary and multiple star systems begins with a molecular cloud, a dense and cold region of space filled with gas and dust. Under the influence of gravity, these clouds can collapse and fragment into multiple cores. This process is described by the Jeans instability criterion. This criterion establishes a threshold for collapse: a cloud - or a part thereof - will collapse if if its radius surpasses the *Jeans length*

$$
    \lambda_{J}
    =
    \left(
        \frac{15 k_{B} T}{4 \pi G m_{p} \mu \varrho}
    \right)^{\frac{1}{2}} \, ,
$$

where $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the temperature of the cloud, $G$ is the gravitational constant, $m_{p}$ is the mass of a proton, $\mu$ is the mean molecular weight of the cloud, and $\varrho$ is the density of the cloud. Similarly, a cloud will collapse if its mass exceeds the *Jeans mass*

$$
    M_{J}
    =
    \frac{4 \pi}{3} \varrho \left( \frac{\lambda_{J}}{2} \right)^{3} \, .
$$

Each of these cores can then undergo further collapse to form a protostar, leading to the formation of a binary or multiple star system.

### 7.1.2 Early Evolution
In the early stages of their evolution, the stars in binary and multiple star systems are often surrounded by a circumstellar disk of gas and dust. These disks are remnants of the molecular cloud from which the stars formed and play a crucial role in the evolution of the system.

One of the key processes that occur during this stage is accretion, where the protostars gain mass by pulling in material from the circumstellar disk. This process is governed by the conservation of angular momentum. As the material in the disk moves inward, it speeds up and forms an accretion disk around the protostar. The material in the accretion disk eventually falls onto the protostar, increasing its mass.

Another important process that occurs during this stage is migration, where the stars move inward or outward due to their interaction with the disk. There are two main types of migration: Type I and Type II:
- **Type I migration** occurs when a star or planet is small enough that it doesn't significantly alter the structure of the disk. In this case, the star or planet can migrate rapidly due to the torques exerted by the disk.
- **Type II migration**, on the other hand, occurs when a star or planet is massive enough to open a gap in the disk. The migration rate in this case is slower and is tied to the rate at which the disk is accreted onto the star or dispersed by the stellar radiation.

These early evolution processes significantly influence the architecture of the binary or multiple star system, determining factors such as the separation between the stars and their mass ratio. Understanding these processes is therefore crucial for understanding the properties of binary and multiple star systems.

### 7.1.3 Late Evolution
As the stars evolve, they can undergo mass transfer, where material is transferred from one star to another. This process can significantly alter the evolution of the stars, leading to phenomena such as blue stragglers, where a star appears younger than it should be due to the accretion of mass from its companion.

The evolution of binary and multiple star systems is also influenced by dynamical interactions with other stars and with the galactic environment. These interactions can lead to changes in the orbital parameters of the stars, and in some cases, can lead to the ejection of one or more stars from the system.

### 7.1.4 End States
The end states of binary and multiple star systems can be quite diverse, ranging from white dwarfs and neutron stars to black holes. In some cases, the interaction between the stars can lead to the formation of exotic objects, such as millisecond pulsars, which are neutron stars that have been spun up by accretion of material from a companion star.

The study of binary and multiple star systems provides crucial insights into the processes of star formation and evolution, and into the dynamics of gravitational interactions. These systems also serve as important laboratories for testing theories of stellar structure and evolution, and for studying the physics of extreme environments.
## 7.2. Mass transfer and accretion in binary systems
Binary systems, where two stars orbit a common center of mass, provide unique environments for the study of stellar evolution. One of the most significant processes that occur in these systems is mass transfer, a phenomenon where matter is transferred from one star (the donor) to another (the accretor). This process can dramatically alter the evolutionary paths of both stars and lead to a variety of astrophysical phenomena.

### 7.2.1 Mechanisms of Mass Transfer
Mass transfer in binary systems can occur through several mechanisms, depending on the properties of the system. The two primary mechanisms are Roche lobe overflow and stellar wind accretion:
- **Roche Lobe Overflow (RLOF)**: Each star in a binary system has a region of space around it, known as its Roche lobe, within which material is gravitationally bound to the star. If a star expands to fill its Roche lobe, material can spill over the L1 Lagrange point (the point of gravitational equilibrium between the two stars) and be accreted by the companion star. This process is known as Roche lobe overflow.
- **Stellar Wind Accretion**: Stars, particularly those in late stages of evolution, can lose mass through stellar winds. In a binary system, some of this wind material can be captured by the companion star. This process is known as stellar wind accretion.

### 7.2.2 Accretion Disks
The material transferred from the donor star does not fall directly onto the accretor. Instead, it forms an accretion disk around the accretor. The formation of the disk is a consequence of the conservation of angular momentum. The material in the disk gradually spirals inward due to viscous forces and is eventually accreted by the star.

### 7.2.3 Impact of Mass Transfer
Mass transfer can significantly affect the evolution of both stars in a binary system. The donor star loses mass and may evolve off the main sequence earlier than it would have in isolation. The accretor gains mass, which can lead to changes in its structure and evolution. In extreme cases, the accretor may gain enough mass to undergo a supernova explosion and form a neutron star or black hole.

It can also lead to the formation of exotic objects and phenomena. For example, if the accretor is a white dwarf and the mass transfer rate is high enough, the material can ignite in a thermonuclear explosion, leading to a nova or type Ia supernova. If the accretor is a neutron star or black hole, the accretion of material can lead to the emission of high-energy X-rays, forming an X-ray binary.

The study of mass transfer and accretion in binary systems provides valuable insights into stellar evolution and the formation of exotic objects. It also allows for the testing of theories of accretion disk physics and the study of high-energy phenomena.

## 7.3. Detection methods for exoplanets
The discovery and study of exoplanets, planets that orbit stars outside of our solar system, has become a major focus of modern astronomy. These planets offer insights into planetary formation and evolution, and the potential for life beyond Earth. Detecting exoplanets, however, is a challenging task due to their small size and the vast distances involved. Several methods have been developed to detect exoplanets, each with its own strengths and limitations.

### 7.3.1. Transit
The transit method is currently the most successful technique for finding exoplanets. It involves observing the brightness of a star over time to detect periodic dips in brightness, which occur when an exoplanet passes in front of (or "transits") the star from our perspective.

The amount of light blocked by the planet gives information about its size, while the period of the transits gives information about the planet's orbital period. Using Kepler's third law, the orbital period can then be used to determine the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.

The transit method is particularly effective for detecting large planets in close orbits around their stars (so-called "hot Jupiters"), but it can also detect smaller, Earth-sized planets under favorable conditions. However, it requires precise photometry and is limited to planetary systems that are oriented such that their planets transit the star as seen from Earth.

### 7.3.2. Radial velocity
The radial velocity method, also known as Doppler spectroscopy, involves observing the Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines caused by the motion of the star around the center of mass of the star-planet system.

As the planet orbits the star, it causes the star to move in a small circular or elliptical motion. This motion leads to changes in the velocity of the star along the line of sight from Earth, which can be detected as shifts in the star's spectral lines due to the Doppler effect.

The radial velocity method gives information about the planet's mass and orbital period, but it requires high-precision spectroscopy and is most effective for detecting large planets in close orbits around their stars.

### 7.3.3. Direct imaging
Direct imaging involves capturing images of the exoplanet directly. This is the most challenging method of exoplanet detection, as the light from the planet is extremely faint compared to the light from the star. However, it provides the most direct evidence of an exoplanet.

Each of these methods has contributed to the discovery and characterization of exoplanets, and future advancements in technology and techniques will undoubtedly lead to the detection of even more exoplanets, including potentially habitable Earth-like planets.

As of 2023, there are over $4\,000$ confirmed exoplanets, with thousands more awaiting confirmation. The majority of these exoplanets have been discovered using the transit method, followed by the radial velocity method. Direct imaging has been used to detect only a handful of exoplanets so far.

## 7.4. Exoplanet characteristics and habitability
The study of exoplanets not only involves their detection but also the determination of their characteristics and potential habitability. These aspects are crucial for understanding the diversity of planetary systems and the possibility of life beyond our Solar System.

### 7.4.1 Exoplanet characteristics
Exoplanets display a wide range of characteristics, including size, mass, composition, temperature, and atmospheric properties. These characteristics can be inferred from the detection methods described earlier.

- **Size and mass**: The size of an exoplanet can be determined from transit observations, while the mass can be inferred from radial velocity measurements. The combination of size and mass can give information about the planet's density, which can provide clues about its composition.
- **Composition**: Exoplanets can range from gas giants similar to Jupiter, composed mainly of hydrogen and helium, to rocky planets like Earth, composed primarily of silicate rock and metal. The composition can be inferred from the planet's density and from spectroscopic observations of its atmosphere.
- **Temperature and atmosphere**: The temperature of an exoplanet depends on its distance from the star and the properties of its atmosphere. The atmosphere can also be studied through spectroscopy, which can reveal the presence of gases like water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, and others.

### 7.4.2 Habitability
The habitability of an exoplanet refers to its potential to support life as we know it. This is typically defined by the planet's location within the habitable zone (or "Goldilocks zone") of its star, where conditions might be just right – not too hot, not too cold – for liquid water to exist on the planet's surface.

However, being in the habitable zone is not the only requirement for habitability. The planet also needs to have a suitable atmosphere and a stable climate. For example, a planet with a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide might experience a runaway greenhouse effect, making it too hot for life, even if it's in the habitable zone.

Furthermore, the planet's star also plays a role in its habitability. Stars with high levels of activity can emit large amounts of harmful radiation, which could strip away the planet's atmosphere or make the surface uninhabitable.

The search for habitable exoplanets is one of the most exciting areas of astronomy, with the potential to answer the age-old question of whether we are alone in the universe.

## 7.5. Impact of host star properties on exoplanetary systems
The properties of a host star can significantly impact the characteristics and evolution of its exoplanetary system. These properties include the star's mass, temperature, luminosity, age, and activity level, among others.

### 7.5.1 Star mass and luminosity
The mass and luminosity of a star determine its gravitational pull and the amount of energy it emits, both of which directly influence the orbits and climates of its planets.

The star's mass affects the size of the orbits of its planets due to the gravitational force. More massive stars will have planets with larger orbits for a given orbital period, according to Kepler's third law.

The star's luminosity, on the other hand, determines the location of the habitable zone, the region around a star where conditions might be right for liquid water to exist on a planet's surface. Stars with higher luminosity have their habitable zones located farther out.

### 7.5.2 Star temperature and spectral type
The temperature of a star, which is related to its spectral type, affects the amount and type of radiation that its planets receive. This radiation can influence the planet's climate and the chemistry of its atmosphere.

For example, M-dwarf stars, which are cooler and redder than our Sun, emit a significant portion of their energy in the infrared. Planets around these stars could have different atmospheric chemistry and climate dynamics compared to those around Sun-like stars.

### 7.5.3 Star age and activity
The age of a star can also impact its exoplanetary system. Young stars are often more active, with higher levels of stellar flares and other forms of stellar activity. This activity can affect the atmospheres of nearby planets, potentially stripping them away entirely.

Moreover, as stars age, they evolve off the main sequence and become red giants, which can engulf planets that are too close. This evolution can also move the location of the habitable zone outward.

### 7.5.4 Metallicity
The metallicity of a star, which refers to the proportion of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium, can influence the formation of planets. Studies have shown that stars with higher metallicities are more likely to have gas giant planets, suggesting that these elements are crucial for planet formation.

In summary, the properties of a host star play a crucial role in shaping the characteristics and evolution of its exoplanetary system. Understanding these effects is therefore essential for the study of exoplanets and the search for habitable worlds.
