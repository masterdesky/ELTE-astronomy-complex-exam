# 8. Compact objects

## 8.1. White dwarfs
### 8.1.1. Formation
White dwarfs are the final evolutionary stage of low- to medium-mass stars (up to approximately $8 M_{\odot}$). They are formed when such a star has exhausted the nuclear fuel in its core. After the red giant phase, the star sheds its outer layers, forming a planetary nebula, while the hot core remains. This core, composed mainly of carbon and oxygen, is the white dwarf.

### 8.1.2. Structure
White dwarfs are extremely dense objects, with a mass comparable to that of the Sun, but a volume similar to that of the Earth. Qunatitatively, their density is on the order of $10^{9} \, \mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{m}^{3}$ – about a million times denser than water.

At the very center of a white dwarf, we find the core, which is mostly made of carbon and oxygen atoms. Moving outwards, the composition gradually changes, and we find a shell of helium surrounding the core, then a shell of hydrogen. However, these aren't like the fusion shells of a massive star – fusion processes in white dwarfs have ceased. These compositional changes are due to the process of gravitational settling, where heavier elements migrate towards the center.

The matter inside a white dwarf is in a state known as electron degenerate matter. This results from the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. In the dense environment of a white dwarf, every low-energy quantum state gets filled up, and electrons are forced into high-energy states, creating a pressure that resists further compression.

### 8.1.3. Evolution
Without nuclear fusion to produce energy and withstand gravity, a white dwarf cools and dims slowly over billions of years and enters a stage known as the "black dwarf" phase. However, this process takes so long that as of our current epoch, the universe is not old enough for any black dwarfs to exist.

The reason it takes so long for white dwarfs to cool down is primarily due to their high thermal conductivity and low surface area to volume ratio. Degenerate electrons within the white dwarf are very mobile and good at conducting heat, so the thermal energy is spread efficiently throughout the star, rather than being concentrated at the surface. This means it takes a long time for the heat to be fully radiated away.

Moreover, white dwarfs are very compact objects. They have a mass similar to the sun but their size is similar to that of Earth. This means they have a relatively small surface area compared to their volume, and since radiation of heat happens at the surface, a smaller surface area means slower cooling.

### 8.1.4. Supernovae Ia
If a white dwarf is in a binary system and accretes matter from its companion star, its mass may approach the Chandrasekhar limit ($\approx 1.4 M_{\odot}$). Beyond this point, the electron degeneracy pressure can't support the dwarf against its own gravity, leading to a runaway carbon fusion reaction, resulting in a type Ia supernova. These supernovae are characteristically very bright and uniform, making them useful as standard candles for cosmological distance measurements.

## 8.2. Neutron stars
### 8.2.1. Formation
Neutron stars form as the end product of supernova explosions, specifically those resulting from stars with an initial mass of about 8 to $20 M_{\odot}$. As such a star exhausts the nuclear fuel in its core, it can no longer generate enough pressure to counteract the force of gravity. Consequently, the core collapses under its own weight, leading to a supernova explosion. The remnant core left behind is incredibly dense, and the immense pressure causes protons and electrons to combine through a process called inverse beta decay, resulting in neutrons. This forms a neutron star. If the mass of the remnant core is above about $3 M_{\odot}$, it will likely collapse into a black hole instead.

### 8.2.2. Structure
Neutron stars consist almost entirely of neutrons and are incredibly dense, with typical masses around $1.4 M_{\odot}$ but radii of only about $10$ kilometers. This leads to densities that far exceed those within atomic nuclei. The structure of a neutron star, while not fully understood, is believed to comprise several layers.

The outermost layer, or crust, is about one kilometer thick and composed of a lattice of ions, mostly iron due to its nuclear stability, with a sea of electrons moving throughout. Beneath this crust, the matter is composed of neutron-rich nuclei. As we delve deeper into the neutron star, the pressure increases significantly, and we encounter a superfluid of neutrons, with some protons and electrons.

The core of the neutron star, its innermost region, remains a topic of ongoing research. It is believed to be fairly similar to that of white dwarfs in principle, but the matter involved is different: instead of electron degenerate matter, the core is filled with "neutron degenerate matter". In the extremely high densities of a neutron star – exceeding the densities of atomic nuclei – the degeneracy pressure of electrons is overcome. Electrons and protons combine to form neutrons (a process called inverse beta decay), leading to a star composed almost entirely of neutrons. The outward pressure in this case is supplied by the degeneracy pressure of these neutrons.

In the most extreme cases, even neutron degeneracy pressure might not be sufficient to resist gravity – it is hypothesized that this could lead to the formation of black holes, but this is still an area of active research.

### 8.2.3. Pulsars
Pulsars are highly magnetized, rapidly rotating neutron stars that emit beams of strong electromagnetic radiation out of their magnetic poles. The name "pulsar" is a portmanteau of "pulsating star," which reflects their appearance: as the star spins and the beam sweeps across our line of sight, it gives the appearance of a star that is pulsating in brightness.

Pulsars are of immense interest in astrophysics because they serve as "natural laboratories" for extreme physics. They possess the strongest magnetic fields and highest densities known anywhere in the universe. Their rapid and regular pulsations also make them incredibly precise cosmic clocks, useful in a range of scientific applications, from testing theories of gravity to detecting gravitational waves.

Despite their extreme conditions, pulsars appear to follow a remarkably stable lifecycle. They are born in supernova explosions, spin rapidly due to the conservation of angular momentum, and gradually slow down over millions to billions of years. The mechanism by which pulsars emit radiation is still a topic of ongoing research, although it is believed to be associated with their strong magnetic fields and rapid rotation.

## 8.3. Black holes
### 8.3.1. Formation
Black holes form from the gravitational collapse of very massive stars typically between $20$ and $100 M_{\odot}$. The life cycle of a star is a balance between the inward pull of gravity, which wants to collapse the star, and the outward push of pressure from nuclear fusion in the star's core, which resists this collapse.

For a star like our Sun, when the nuclear fuel is exhausted, the core will collapse to become a white dwarf, and electron degeneracy pressure will be sufficient to halt further collapse. If the star is more massive, the core will collapse to a neutron star, and neutron degeneracy pressure will halt further collapse.

However, for even more massive stars, even neutron degeneracy pressure is not enough to resist gravity. When these stars have exhausted their nuclear fuel, their cores collapse completely, creating a black hole. This usually occurs in a violent explosion known as a supernova, which can eject the outer layers of the star into space. The core that remains after the supernova, if it's more than about $3 M_{\odot}$, will collapse to form a black hole.

In addition to this stellar mass black hole formation, it is believed that supermassive black holes, found at the centers of galaxies, form through a different process. They could form from the collapse of very large clouds of gas in the early universe, or from the merger of many smaller black holes, or from a combination of these and other processes. As of 2023, the formation of these special type of black holes is still a topic of ongoing research in astrophysics.

### 8.3.2. Physical properties
Black holes are characterized by only three properties: mass, spin, and charge. For astrophysical black holes, charge is typically negligible, so they are often described just by their mass and spin. We refer to this as the "no-hair theorem" of black holes, which states that black holes are completely characterized by these two (three) properties.

These peculiar objects are primarily characterized by a region of spacetime called the event horizon and a central formation referred to as the singularity. The event horizon is a spherical or ellipsoidal boundary in spacetime around the central singularity, beyond which nothing can escape, not even light. The exact size of the event horizon is directly proportional to the mass of the black hole.

The singularity is the region in the center, where the curvature of spacetime becomes infinite according to general relativity. However, it is expected that quantum gravity effects become important at the singularity, and our current theories are not able to accurately describe what happens there neither mathematically nor physically.

Due to the conservation of angular momentum, practically all black holes are expected to rotate. The exact spin of a black hole is characterized by the dimensionless parameter $a$, which ranges from $0$ (non-rotating) to $1$ (maximally rotating). The spin of a black hole is expected to be proportional to its mass, so we can also characterize it by the dimensionless spin parameter $a_*$, which is defined as $a_* = a / M$, where $M$ is the mass of the black hole.

### 8.3.3. Evolution
Once formed, black holes can grow by absorbing mass from their surroundings. In the centers of galaxies, supermassive black holes can accumulate millions to billions of solar masses.

Black holes can also lose mass and energy through a process called Hawking radiation, a quantum mechanical effect, which is effectively the blackbody radiation of black holes. However, for astrophysical black holes, this effect is incredibly weak and as of 2023, has not been observed yet.

### 8.3.4. Types of black holes
Black holes are typically classified into a few types based on their physical properties, namely their mass, spin, and electric charge. The two most commonly discussed types in astrophysics are the Schwarzschild black hole and the Kerr black hole.

1. **Schwarzschild Black Holes**: These are the simplest type of black hole, characterized by having only mass and no spin or electric charge. They are named after Karl Schwarzschild, who was the first to solve Einstein's field equations for a spherically symmetric, non-rotating mass. The event horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole is a perfect sphere, and the geometry of the spacetime outside it is spherically symmetric.

2. **Kerr Black Holes**: Most black holes in the universe are expected to be rotating, and these are described by the Kerr solution to Einstein's field equations, named after Roy P. Kerr who found the solution in 1963. These black holes are characterized by both their mass and their spin. The spin of a Kerr black hole drags nearby spacetime around with it, an effect known as frame-dragging. This leads to the existence of the ergosphere, a region outside the event horizon where objects cannot remain stationary. Inside the event horizon, there is also a region known as the inner horizon or Cauchy horizon, but the physical reality of this inner horizon is a topic of ongoing research.

It is theoretically possible for a black hole to have electric charge, leading to the so-called "Reissner-Nordström black hole" (charge but no spin) or "Kerr-Newman black hole" (both charge and spin), but in practice astrophysical black holes are expected to be nearly neutral, because any net charge would quickly be neutralized by infalling charged particles from the surrounding plasma. Therefore, these charged black hole solutions are more of theoretical interest than astrophysical relevance.

Each type of black hole has a unique set of properties and implications for the behavior of matter and radiation near the black hole. These properties have a wide range of implications, from the production of jets of matter and energy in active galactic nuclei, to the nature of the gravitational waves produced when black holes merge.
